THE LEFT ENCYCLOPEDIA-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
A ball here, there a children's treat,
A ball in Peter's capital,
Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
"Abandon hope for ever here!”
Abandoning insane delight,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
About the crop of hay, the wine,
About the rain and flax and cattle.”-
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,-
A box of terrible import.
A breathless silence then, prolonged-
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtain-
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Accents of rapture or despair
A certain little escapade
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
A constant harping on one tune,
A coquette loves by calculation,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A country damsel's album trim,
Acquaintance instantly to make.
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Address to you one single phrase
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Adieu she to the matron said
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
A duellist of classic mind,
A due which must to earth be paid.
"Advance!”-Indifferent and sedate,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful model she appeared
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
Affectionately yours till death.
Affection how did you requite?
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A first success light pinions gave,
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fond and careful mother been.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A friar black approaching near,
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
After the wedded couple strain;
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Against my inclination, friends,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhood-love?
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
Age immature averse to cheat-
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
A gust of passion never tore
A hand of ice appeared to seize
A happy destiny ordained:
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
Ah! he has gone the other way”-
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
Ah! I'm so weak-my throbbing breast!
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Ah! it may be, affection true
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”-
A horse's hoofs she hears-She shrinks!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
A hundred times will not repeat,
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
A jolly song and distant horn;
A joyous troop of little boys
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A kerchief round her silver hair
Akulka who was once Celine,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
"Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!”
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Alas! with merited reproach.
Albums magnificent which scare
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest;
A life of fact, not fiction, led-
Alike by sighs and flattery.
"Aline!”
A little farther please to read
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
All about Olga-to a light
All are amazed; but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become;
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All in the good old style appears,
All is foreseen. My secret drear
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire;
All that the heart would fain express-
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this may be an empty dream,
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All this was novel to Eugene.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are gone-
Allure the young gallant
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Almost became a poet say-
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone within his habitation
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Along the hall, and high above
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A lover's letter might convey,
A love which knew no limitation,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already dance to song proceeds;
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also my wretched liberty
Also one Viázemski, remarking
Also their feet-yet ne'ertheless
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
A maiden's secrets-of the heart.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A mansion-by the window, see!
A marriageable maid matured,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amidst successes flattering
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
Am I to go through the whole list?”
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.-
An ardent heart and yet so mild?-
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And about dawn upon his breast
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And after Albion's proud lyre
And after them at headlong pace
And "Agathon” replied, amazed.
And agitate my heart again;
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a half rubles down gave she;
And aimless journeys did commence-
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all that from thy hand proceeds-
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all the three to breakfast went;
And all thy precious elegies,
And all with one accord agreed,
And all without her husband's leave.
And all your love on self bestow;
And a long time about her talked.
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verse-
And a malicious epigram
And ancient usages observed
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an encouragement did breathe
And a new diadem supplied.
And an habitual sense of pain;
And an old gent the poet marking
And a romance in ancient style
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great;
And at the altar of their fame
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And at the table sat her down.
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happy-as I might.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And be not in advance severe.
And better, if I judge aright;
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And bitter torment never known.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a sweet delusion he
And by degrees upon him grew
And by that shady rivulet
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And, by the way, I here assert
And by the world repeated oft,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And can it be? But late a child
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed;
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And clad in airy costume took
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And contemplative dreaminess;
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.
And disappear in space; then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And dost thou know her?”-"We live near.”
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,-
And ease the tortures of the heart-
And education runs to waste,
And (elbows on the table) they
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and love-
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And every morning I awake
And every year distributed
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And eye which gleams with inspiration-
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And far removed from rumour vain;
And fashionable magazines,
And fashion's gay frivolities;
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been;
And finally he deigns let fall
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And fled afar-she followed me.
And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
And flooded all the level ground.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And following them ye might espy
And for a time our course delay,
And form a network left and right;
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And freezing fits of weariness.
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the country all around
And from the Millionaya afar
And from the misty woodland nigh
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gallops to her house away.
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And gently hovered o'er my head?
And glasses unemployed all night;
And glittering simpletons beside;
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grant success to labour long;
And grasp a stirrup fortunate-
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And happy unto you appear.
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And harmony was soon restored.
And hastened to his uncle's side,
And hated casual visitors,
And hates the world's discordant ways.
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar”
And heard a voice cry-Why! He's killed!-
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
"And he-but of him presently-
And heedless of approval seems,
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And honestly 'tis my belief
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And husbands' tedious amity?
And I admired their common sense
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I confess that now-a-days
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
And if Tattiana mine had found-
And impiously should declare,
And in addition youth is flame
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she
And in reality one day
And in society might shed
And, inspiration firing me,
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And in the morning doth not know
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And irrigate them with champagne;
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
"And is it long since back he came?
"And is it,” meditates Eugene.
"And is it she? It must be-no-
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And isolated from all men,
And it may be a secret dread
And I to give thee cakes was wont?”-
And jests doth recapitulate.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And judgment which unsteady veers
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And leads a solitary life?
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
And leans upon the monster's arm,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And led me off to church with song.”
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And Lenski followed-a light broke-
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like a palisade flit by.
And like a shadow haunted her.
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like Napoleons each of us
And like the prisoner's our delight
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And lo! he is already there!
And lonely through the forest creeps.”
And long her eyes as through a haze
And long internal agitation
And long perukes hath vanished.
And love's delicious diadem
And loves you as-a relative!
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
And make a dark existence shine
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And many another slily sneered;
And marking Tania's agitation,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And may fall headlong any time.
And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my dark soul to light was brought;
And my Eugene the path must trace-
And my romance's open theme
And my Tattiana now began
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And never was the ear affright
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees;
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now, I mournfully confess,
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she spring
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now we hear delightedly
And numerous pages had preserved
And o'er the granite coping bent,
And oft at eventide a throng
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft in whispers would impart
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!
And ought he not to disregard
And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire;
And overcome antipathies
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And pelt him with cherries,
And physic bring with mournful face,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
And pressed her hand-the crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn-
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And sermon-but in that dread hour
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And she at last hath us deceived;
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And showed with an uncertain light
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And silently I here must die-
And since I pulled thee by the ear-
And slowly life coagulates-
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And so departed. But Eugene,
And so-God bless them, if He list.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
And sometimes into snares as well
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And soon imagination threw
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
And soon Oneguine's door beside
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fire-
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And still the coachmen round the fires
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate;
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation;
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
And Tania's husband soon appeared.-
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice;
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the heart's agitated dreams.
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lime alley's twilight dim
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then "monsieur” supplied her place;
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then to meditate for days
And then with blind credulity
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide;
And these the attentive maid observed
And the Skatenines, aged pair,
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And they the waters recommend.
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though I read it with distress,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy inebriating wave
And thy protection I implore.
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to Oneguine far away
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And to the field of honour led;
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery;
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread-
And unto whom we all allude
And usually despised it too),
And vanish like a bird in air.
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And views amongst themselves advance
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
And we-an unattractive set-
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And what will Destiny concede?”
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewed-
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where a madrigal occurs
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And wholly occupied his day-
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wild among them grew her words-
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And yet the city's flower was there,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
An ear to my confession lend;
An ever transcendental flight;
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
A new proprietor arrived,
Anew the flames of passion start
A new world was made manifest!
An exile from their troublous reign,
An explanation: she was scared,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
An honourable course ye took,
An hour passed by-another-till,
Anicia soon appears, the door
An idle anchorite and sad,
An infant maiden doth exhort
An innate love of meditation,
An inn at every stage erect.
An invalid from lung complaint.
Announcing to him dinner-time.
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Another bard with art divine
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
Another his betrothed was given;
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Another! to none other I
Another tribune of the ball
Another visit hastes to pay.
Another with cock's head appeared,
A notoriety proclaimed,
An oval countenance and pink,
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
A pair of bullets-nought beside-
A pair; though desolate my mind,
A paragon of virtue he!
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
A passionate desire to bend
A pensive sorrow in her glance
A philosophic anchorite:
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Appear; along the road of Tver
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Applause, the people's donative.
Approach, approach; I am thine own.”
Approaches Olga and the pair
Approach not to gaze at
Approach not to hearken
A print without the picture's grace,
A promenade in twilight late
A prudent man like you and brave
Are admirable, my dear friend,
Are all your relatives quite well?
A register of fleeting thought,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Are oft deceptive-like their feet.
Are turned upon her. All combine
Are ye replaced by other maids
A riding whip. She strolls along.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Arising with the morning's light,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Around her neck, now violently
Around my stanzas incomplete
Around the carriage of the pair-
Around the garden homeward hies.
Around the meadow and the grove.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Arrange without the least delay-
A Russian household simple quite,
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
A Russian poem's mechanism
As a babe's slumber, or the light
As a poetic life serene,
As bees who leave their dainty store
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
A scant attendance Lenski showed
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
As cyphers others to appraise,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
A sense of social delight,
As every journal now entreats,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
As formerly much agitation.
As formerly the shepherd sits
As giddy youth's hilarity-
A shape half cat and half a crane.
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
As if against obstruction sore
As if he cruelly had joked!
As if impossible it were
As if it were some funeral feast.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As if with eider-down is filled.
A simple tombstone hath been set.
As in a garden when I grew,
As in a thicket's humble shade,
A single being: 'twas in fine
As in her heart the thought sank home,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
As in their turn the seasons roll.
As in the timid forest deer,
As it were, tore himself away.
A slave of actresses capricious,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As many dinners I rehearse,
As many entertainments be!
As men who much had done that day.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
As oft to meat and drink advert,
A something somehow have obtained,
As once, to fill the rapid page
As one who bivouacs afield,
As on the rapid wings of thought
As partner of my mournful days,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A sportsman who in covert lies.
As rosy lips without a smile,
As Saadi anciently averred-
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Assemblies oligarchical
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Assistance ever will extend,
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Assuredly should not have been
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
As the reflection of his age,
As the sins of my youthful days
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
As to a worthy man and good!
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
A strong resemblance these possess-
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Asunder was and hate prepared?
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
As we lure the young gallant,
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
As Winter in their purity,
As with innumerable fires.
As yet none had discovered aught;
As your light footprints on the green.
A table to the fire is brought,
At a great feast against desire,
A tangled wilderness around.
At an old aunt's they had arrived
At each extreme one takes his stand,
At early morn returns the maid
At eighteen not to play the fool!
A tender couplet he combined,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
At eventide would hither come,
At fifty who relief obtained
At first, but soon became inured
At first for books was disinclined,
At first, I clung to secrecy:
At first such contradictions wrought
At forty suffered from the gout,
A thick immense neglected grove
At his pale brow a shot to have,
At home arriving he addressed
Athwart the snow four paces came-
A timid love to banishment?-
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
At Larina's abode produced
"At Larina's.”-"Hem, that is queer!
At last became a ruined man.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At last my father gave his blessing,
At last the author!” cries Mamma.
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
At morn an icy bath within
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
At morn I must assuredly
At neighbouring hospitalities.
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
At prisoner's base she never played.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
A true account and in detail.
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
At Russ she was by no means clever
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At table she was sitting by
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Attentive be unto my rhymes
Attentive listened to his speech,
Attentive listened to the lad.
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
At the front gates, but in brief space
At the same hour she oped her eyes
At thirty who was married well,
At this time almost understood.
At times, if only once a week,
At times my reason almost bends,
At times talk nonsense with design;
At times three words to him addressed
At times to silence would resort,
Attractive in its banefulness?
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light-
Authors replete with sacred fire
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
A valuable hostage gained,
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A very troublesome disease,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
A village and beneath, a wood,
A visionary mortified,
A visionary personage
A vision desolate and drear
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awakens secret merriment
Away! and cease to ring their praise
Away her golden earrings tore;
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
A weary season was at hand-
A while ago the winter spent,
Awhile sound conversation seems
Awhile this beauty captivated,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A white and undulating pall
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A windmill too a jig performs
A wish from place to place to roam,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
Aye bids ye in some way or other-
A young and handsome galliard.
A young Armida's lips to press,
A young man motionless he saw,
Back to his regiment must roam.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Bard of the "Feasts,” and mournful breast,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Basins and jugs-well! everything
Bear gone-she at the threshold placed;
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Because a member I became.
Because he could not gourmandise
Because her passion wanted art,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Because in singleness of thought
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because she was so innocent,
Become a faithful wife and e'en
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Bedding is laid out and to all
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Before a fire which feebly glows
Before he eighteen years attained.
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Before him her wild game of chance.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Before such fond simplicity
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Before the dregs they shall divine
Before whom once in solitude,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Before you agonized to die-
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind her a grave general.
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain-”
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Behold the dames who once were fine
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Behold! the world's opinion!
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Believe me, of my present shame
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Besides, a duellist well-known
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Beside the stormy sea one day
Beside the thundering abyss
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Better than Chateaubriand did
Between myself and my Eugene,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Beyond this may attempt to write.
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill-”
Born of a babbler in a loft
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Both day and night he now must pass
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
"Bring dinner now without delay!”
Bringing his partner corpulent
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Bruin is marching at her back!
Bu, ere he mounts the marble flight,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Buried in meditation deep,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But, after mutual compliments,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead-
But, as he never opened them,
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But as to fighting-'twill appear!
But at a later, sterile age,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But better loved the soft repose
But boldly I myself resign:
But borne in spirit far away
But by degrees the crowd begin
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But cannot anyhow evade
But cannot stand the northern cold.
But competition I abjure
But contrary to her advice
But could not. Then she questioned him:-
"But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,
"But death from him will be delight.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
But Eugene, hating litigation
But Eugene, incontestably,
But Eugene long hath left the press
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But even thus not now-a-days!
But fashionable hatred's flame
But finally grew bored by her.
But finally he oped his eyes
But finally in wedlock bind.
But finally she heaves a sigh,
But finally she softly said:
But first permission did request
But followed the strict rules of art,
But fools-their calumnies and sneers”-
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But from the interview what flowed?
But from the Muses' loftiest height
But gazes on Oneguine's face
But grant with magnanimity
But gray Phillippevna the door
But grown familiar side by side
But he desired not to beguile
But, her own room in memory,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
But home his body to despatch
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
But I abandoned their array,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
But I am now another's bride-
But I await thee: scarce alive
But I came not to adulate:
But if my lot unfortunate
But if the truth I must relate,
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
But I must add to what I write
But I must now employ my Muse
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
But I perceive thou dost not heed-”
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
But it grew late; he must not stay;
But I the products of my Muse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But I-what is all this to me?
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But, knowing not the actual truth,
But Lenski, having no desire
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
But lights incendiary flames
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But lo! already the moon's light
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But look you-ah! do not refuse.”
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But man of sense and probity.
But memory like a serpent's tooth
But merely to exasperate;
But more the passions occupy
"But, mátushka, to Moscow you
But my Oneguine the whole eve
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
But no reply unto her made.
But not at present, though sincerely
But nothing changed in them is seen,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
But now all doubt was set aside,
But now a question in this wise
But nowhere can she find repose,
But now in her effulgence pale
But now my mind is desolate,
But now-my very blood congeals,
But now-none heeds the monument
But now our hero we must leave
But now our minds are mystified
But now ridiculous a bit.
But now-what brings you to my feet?-
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But of this love, e'en casually,
But Olga would not such peruse.
But once more pensive and distressed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But one thought only filled his mind,
But on the third of grove and mead
But, O ye tomes without compare,
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But presently she tried to read;
But promise of our meeting gave,
But proudly in his song preserved
But round the hostess scintillate
But sad is the reflection made,
But say he was a genius who
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But send your grandson before long.”
But shall depict the touching scene
But she, her sister never heeding,
But since to the backdoor they led
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But somehow there shone in his look
But soon she altered all her ways,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But stares into the darkness deep.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But still more stupid did appear
But still remembrance to him clings,
But stop! I will present thee, if
"But strange am I to happiness;
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But such is not for me. I brood
But such is not my project now,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
But suddenly all changed around!
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But Summer swiftly fades away
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But sweeter still it is to arrange
But Tania just as in a dream
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
But tell me what am I to do?
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But, that life longer may remain,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But that the eyes of every one
But the dark sepulchre I may
But the date subsequently changed
But the indifferent princess,
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But the young unpolluted heart
But this adventure's consequence
But this a heinous crime appeared
But this amusement delicate
But this is my advice, 'twere best
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But thoughts meander far away-
But time flies and she doth forget
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
But to Oneguine! A propos!
But to the garden once again
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?-
But turning morning into night,
But turn we once more to our dame.
But ultimately doth approach.
But upon all that Eugene knew
But was our friend Eugene content,
But were it not immoral I
But what a nuisance it will be,
But what astonished do I find
But what results? His eyes peruse
But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
But when the winter season came
But when two minutes she had sat,
But wherefore not?-'Tis pleasant, nice,
But where Melpomene doth rave
"But which, my dear?-In days of yore
But who abandon it-as I
But who in that choice company
But why are your cheeks whitening?”
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But will not modify a tittle-
But with austerity!-for you
But with confused and bashful air,
But with her elder sister I
But word for word his letter read.
But would not look at Cicero.
But wretched who anticipates,
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
But you must both be quite tired out!
By absence who hath chilled his love,
By an avowal just as plain.
By an obrok's indulgent rate:
By a rich pie were occupied-
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
By bee and butterfly which pass.
By "belle Tattiana” to replace.
By children and by faithful wife
By computation) it is like
By daily life deteriorated,
By dull insensibility,
By every proper-minded wife,
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
By flattery and lover's art-
By fond illusions once possest
By friendship how they were abused,
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
By his embarrassed dignity-
By indolence and languor fired
By liberties or loose or light.
By love's inevitable flame.
By many a lamp illuminate,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
By neighbouring families bewept,
By night prepared for sorcery,
By Olga's hand distributed
By Olga stood, dejected quite
By other thoughts be occupied.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
By Providence's dark decree!
By rank as settled by the State.
By recklessness amuse or shame
Byron's capricious phantasy
By such allusions scandalous,
By sympathy I have been driven.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
By the fine silver of the north.
By their own horses, not the post-
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
By the sick lady's gaiety
By time (who can anticipate?)
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
By visions who was ne'er deranged
By waters shining tranquilly,
By what idea or observation
By whom the youthful bard was slain?”-
Calling to mind your icy look
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Callous to all on earth become-
Calm and without embarrassment,
Calmly her eyes encounter his-
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Can count the time without much fuss-
Can hearty welcome give alone.
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?”
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Cannot they amicably smile
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Can she have been a moment gone
Canto the First of this romance.
Can we not stealthily make out
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
Careless of every social rule,
Careless of fame his spirit high
Caricatures he now designed
Carried a truth divine away;
Carried away by ecstasy,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Caught him and by the collar took
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Certainly not Eugene alone
Certain misfortune near opined.
Chained to his bedside night and day
Change of position had essayed,
Charming is your sincerity,
Charming with grave simplicity.
Charms more enduring in the end.
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
China and bronze the tables weight,
Choosing a profitable trade,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,-
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
"Come,” she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
Come sing we in chorus
Come to my golden palace, dear!
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Command him not to say a word-
"Command me, darling, what you choose”-
Commence a new career in life
Companion of my childhood's days.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Confront thy fated torturer!
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Conquer by passion and address,
Conscious of death approximate,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Constant affection intertwined
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Contented and with victuals stored,
Conventionality's dull tool-
Corneille's majestic genius,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Could in romantic mantle drape
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?”
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Cunning already to display
Cursing his own stupidity,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Customs by ages sanctified,
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Daily of love in solitude.
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Dark shadows thicken-a dread cry
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Dark was the valley and the wood
Debate commanded ample food-
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!”
Deep in the distant province rude,
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Deep into debt his father ran;
Deliberate approach of guests
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Delighted glances in return;
Delighted much his former ways
"Delighted.”-"When?”-"This very night.
Delusions of a mind untried,
Demands that I translate for you
Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
"Departed Lenski here to dine
Departed, ordered out his horse
Depart in peace and friendly live?
Depicted on your haughty face!
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
Descended swift in turbid streams
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Describe in detail the affair,
Descried before me suddenly!
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Desire to rule ye may observe
Desirous to annihilate
Despair and anger seize on me,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Detecting him the passing horse
Detest him for a brother slain?
Develops and matures its powers,
Device of rural minds acute!)
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Diminishes as years decline.
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Discovered much absurdity,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Displayed a noble rectitude-
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Distinctly not its mechanism.
Distracted by her grief appears
Divinity without access
Do agitate his late repose.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Do me a favour and appear.
Domestic life attracts me still,
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
Do not excuse yourself. I read
"Do not-you might-suspicious be;
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Doth in us or our names appear
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Drank to her health in the first place,
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go-
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Dreams with no continuity,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Dressed like a London dandy he
Dressing as quickly as he can,
"Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Economy political,
E'en as the poet says he leant.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
E'en for an instant find delight,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Either she saw not or ignored;
Either with him or thee in song,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,-
Employ your glasses constantly,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Encountered punishment complete,
Endless conjectures all propound
Endowing us from out her store
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Enhances love in estimation
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows-
Ennui can in the country dwell
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay-
Enough! my pack is now unslung-
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Enraptured was he if allowed
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
Epicurean philosophers,
Epistle second, note the third,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Ere conversation could begin,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
Ere this but one brief moment beat
E sempre bene, gentlemen!
Espy him approaching,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Et cetera; but nothing showed
Eternally to imitate
ETOT FILE CHISTIL MAXIM KATKOV
Eugene at first began to dream,
Eugene designed with me to start
Eugene directs the trusty man
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet-
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Eugene of course related nought,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Even amusing fools we miss
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Even as the love of children dear.
Even beneath her parents' roof
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Eventually petrify
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Ever to hear the same replies
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Examined, mended, newly found
Examine her from head to foot.
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Except one by the window placed
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
Excruciate the heart and late
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Existence calmly sped along,
Existence without wife or friends,
Existence would not make a curse,
Exist-that their immortal band
Extended-haunt which Dryads love.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Extinguished ashes do not blaze-
Faces which we meet everywhere
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Familiar to him long ago.
Fantastic images shall swarm
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Far from his Italy-his own.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Farther Tattiana's walks extend-
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Fashion is there immutable,
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
Felled a calumniator base!
Finally tost his arms in air
First reconciled and then content;
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Fles past the porter to the stair,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Follow up love-a secret meeting
Fond declarations they invite
For a fictitious misanthrope,
For a protracted space of time.
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
For consecrate to me he fell
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
For ever faithful will abide.”
For evermore had disappeared.
For evermore is separate.
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
For every loyal Russian breast!
For ever your Tattiana leave.
For first "madame” his wants observed,
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
Forgotten in the village lone,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
For him an honourable grave,
For him were but of little worth,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
For journalistic deglutition
For law I far niente take
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
For long-for ever. To be sure
For long he had endured them all.
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For my wild garden and bookcase,-
For o'er a word to fashion known,
For on their brows I trembling read
For otherwise-God only knows!
For our amusement ever made
For our Automedons are fire
For patience, reader, I must plead!
For promises her feet reveal
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For rural solitude and dreams,
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
For summer to the country flown,
For tallow, wood and other things
For the first time the hammer clicks.
For the impatient chief instead.
For there he left a mournful trace.
For the young poet they display.
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
For treachery had done its worst;
Fortune the poet had repaid.
For twice you came to them and yet
For two whole days it seemed a change
For us, may be for many a year.
For visions of my childish years
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
For which the poet agonized
For who imposture can endure,
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
For your instruction here to tell
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Found the ideal of my youth,
Found them in darkness side by side,
Four deadly paces do they span;
Fragments of northern poetry,
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Friends and companions,
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Friends of the sons of every land,
From apprehension of the cost,
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
From careless stanzas such as these,
From everything the heart held dear
From first to last page to the rim.
From gales a hill behind was seen;
From Gottingen inspired he came,
From habit or maliciously,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
From happy inspiration flow,
From hence engrossed in thought profound
From henceforth I confide to thee!
From her half-open vest of night.
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
From mere vacuity of mind
From public and from private ties,
From Romulus unto our day.
From shades of the relentless past.
From storms protection having sought,
From such digressions wholly free.
From the dread pistol turn away.
From the moist cork the bottle freed
From whose analysis minute
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Full many a lovely star hath night
Full of exasperating thought.
Funeral amateurs abound!
Furious he from the table rose;
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing-see!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Gazing into his face, she said:
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand-
Gazing upon a note below.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Girls the kashourka much prefer.
Give me just half a glass of wine-
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
Gliding in negligent career,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Glory with which our history teems
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
God grant I meet not at a ball
God grant that all who herein glance,
God knows! The very trace is lost.
God save his soul eternally
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go.”-
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
Grant that I err not on the road.”
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Gravely repeating to another
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petòushkoff
Habit alleviates the grief
Habit was given us in distress
Habit would bring indifference.
Had a deluded victim been
Had bid her sigh for without hope-
Had come both friends and enemies-
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
Had finished life amid his sons,
"Had he been long here, and where from?
Had killed me had the like been told.”
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Had much to do at home that day,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Had perished a creative mind,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Had rendered him an invalid;
Had run across her path at speed,
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Happy and glorious. But this brings
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Happy who thereto can unite
Happy who timely grew mature,
Hard by the window took her place.”-
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hateful the hollow world became,
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Have echoed to eternity.
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
Have entered never to return.
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Have my Oneguine-suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Having for money's sake alone
Having lost all in life we prize.
Having once fixed your interest,
Having performed his service truly,
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
Having this mournful document
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Heard he the truth? And thus she could-
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Hears not my importunity!
Heart would not throb albeit in jest-
Heaved an involuntary sigh
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
He back as from a sudden blow?-
He bending whispered in her ear
He bends his course to Talon's, where
He "Benedetta” used to hum,
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
He brought from mystic Germany
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
He called upon me Christmas Eve-
He cannot give me happiness.”
He cared no longer there to stay,
He conversation would have led-
He could in disputation shine
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He drops his pistol silently.
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her stares-
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He hath acquired the world's esteem
"He hath neglected us of late.”-
He heard his soul's complaint within,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,”
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He knits his brows-'tis silent all.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left you first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He might his motives have narrated,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw;
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on his bosom gently placed
He on the conflagration frowned.
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
"He promised here this day to ride,”
He quits the fashionable throng
He racked his brains to find its clue
Her agitation and distress
Her all in all did constitute;
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her brow she did not e'en contract
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
He read as vainly as before,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
Herein my portrait should detect,
Here I remark all poets are
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Her head upon her breast declines
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her money counted, and designed
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
He roars, and "Ah!” Tattiana cries.
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Her path across the plain doth keep-
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulder-Olga swiftly came-
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave-
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears-
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
He's a freemason, so we think.
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
He sang of love-to love a slave.
He sang of separation grim,
He's a straightforward little chap.”
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way;
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is master-that is plain;
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He took no more the slightest heed;
He took the room wherein the old
He to the festival repairs,
He used to hate-and was no fool-
He usually was glad to see
He wakes-they with a letter come-
He wanders in his indolence;
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful fool-
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error; for Eugene
He was most gay. The happy date
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He went not-sooner was prepared
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He who life's frosts which early wrung
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
He would not that a man ye slay
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Highways all Russia will unite
Him a disquietude did seize,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Himself transformed into a hack;
Him who inspired both love and awe,
His ardent soul with full delight.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
His breast was riddled through and through,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His care unto his pistols' plight,
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
His chambers close wherein confined
His character attracted me.
His comedies, a noisy rout,
His constant soul could ever tire,
His course unto the running brook.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
His daily occupations, lo!
His daughter's book to ascertain
His ditties were as pure and bright
His double sashes and his grate,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
His energy and impotence.
His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
His fate shall presently decide.
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
His footing on the treacherous rime
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His friends and also enemies
His friendship I acquired just then;
His furs are powdered on the way
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His harp beneath that sky had rung
His hate by slander, and who spends
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His heart reciprocated still
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
His immorality of mind
His inner consciousness laid bare,
His intellect in close array.
His kneeling posture he retains-
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His malady, whose cause I ween
His momentary loving glance
His mother from the door doth scold.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His name: the tenderness of home
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
His own antagonists expert,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
His recent glory he invokes.
His relative and friend as well.
His ruffian bravery adored,
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
His son and mortgages his lands.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His son is married, just conceive!”
His soul by crash of music fired,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
His spirit was intent upon.
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His tea with rum no more desired,
His transports were quite maidenly,
His travels like all other things
His uncle, busy man indeed,
His valet brings him letters three.
His vanity first let us pique
His visit she had not awaited,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
His watch, the sun in turn he views-
His weary head declined at rest,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His wife was also mad upon
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
Homeward returning, he at home
Honour and pride inflexible.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Hope with her fascinating power
Horror! had she not better stay
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
How artless was the note which spoke
How bitterly he would malign,
How bright and tender was his look,
"How came you then to wed a man?”-
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
How empires store of wealth unfold,
However cherries might abound,
However, Tania's letter reading,
However, the mazurka lacks
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”-
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How I have erred and felt the rod!
How in the country pass this time?
How like a poet was my chum
How like the billow I desired
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How meekly then I heard you preach-
How much is in that word expressed!
"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?”-
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
"How often in thine arms I lay;
How oft the kindly Muse away
How oft to the Crimean shore
How oft, when on a summer night
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt deception's art,
How soon he learnt to titillate
How soon to habits she conformed
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thoroughly her part she took!
How thy hands burn!”-"Dear nurse, I'm well.
How well he played the greenhorn's part
How with thy medal I would play,
Hung like a print against the wall,
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
I, after so much eloquence,
I also wandered there of old,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
"I am in love,” her whispers tell
I am in love, my hour hath come!
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
I am-in love-you know-don't tell!”
I am not strong enough to state;
I am not worthy them in aught;
I Apuleius gladly read
I ask, all ye who poets are,
I blame not your behaviour-
I by the button-hole seize fast
"I call to witness God on high-”
I cannot help it I declare,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
I cannot tell on what pretence-
I cannot tell the reason why,
I cannot understand. But lo!
I can't conceive a little dear
I can't translate the adjective.
"I celebrate a comrade young
"Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
I did not please you. Why pursue
Idolatry of liberty,
I envied sore the billows tall,
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
I feel, allotted is my span;
I feel thou wast by God sent down
If he had only known the wound
If his hot hand encountered hers,
If in the scenes of home I might
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
If not, the money I will lend.”
If Olga smilingly approve,
I formerly admired her much
If seriously he hath disease;
If the choice in my power were,
"If the domestic hearth could bless-
If the fond hope I could have fanned
If the poor maiden could have guessed
If the raw product they possess
If they but heard domestic loads
If they were similar in aught.
If thou wert sitting by my side,
If wife and children to possess
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
I guard it as a holy thing,
I had found my predestinate,
I have dreamed many a vision fair
I have endured without respite.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
I have known beauties cold and raw
I have no leisure here to dwell,
I heard thy voice's resonance
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
I just hint, in parenthesis,
I know not if his heart felt pain
I know that Parny's tender pen
I know there's none more amiable.
I lift a warning voice because
I like the difference to express
I like this word exceedingly
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.-
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
I long by ballets have been bored,
I long enough deceived have erred.
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
I loved you-what did I obtain?
I love its furious delight,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
I love you-to what end deceive?-
I love you with a brother's love,
Imagination's sacred fires,
Imagine! Here alone am I!
I married-now, I supplicate-
I'm beaten in another matter;
I mean my name not to repeat.”
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?”-
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed-
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Impatient waits the close of day,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
Impelled to union with his own
Imperial portraits hang around
Impetuously clove its way
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Impressed him in the least degree,-
Impressionable for an hour,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared-
I must resign myself, in sooth;
In age the memory gets worse,
In a half-open dressing-gown
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In a lax or informal way,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
In books he saw nought to condemn
In boston and the game of age,
In bud of promise incomplete,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Incessantly his chains to break.”
In charming fashion mutilate?
Incited by his stormy Muse
In clouds of steam above perceive.
In coach or post-cart duly placed
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
In company, or simply bowed,
In consultation stand aside-
In correspondence been allowed.
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
In country solitude you mope,
In country towns, where still it keeps
In course of time (the whole extent
In cruel solitude each day
Indeed, by force of magnetism
Indifferent he became to all,
Indifferent was her future fate.
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
In dreams and what the moon foretold
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
In duel having killed his friend
I never should have seen your face
In fact, some people were assured
In fact, the subject analysed,
Infallibly you there will find
Inflict annoyance and distress
In former years thus did not I
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
In groups, official striplings glance
Inhabited the country, clad
In haunts of fashion where each day
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
In her friends' albums, time had been,
Inheritor of all his race.
In history he took no pleasure,
In hopes of everlasting fame
In horror for itself alone,
In idleness and tranquil joy
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In life domestic see a string
In little maidens of thirteen?
In love adventures she was versed,
In love, although its tempests vex,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
In many things had changed his life-
In melancholy loveliness,
In mist profound all yet is hid.
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
In motley and amusing chase.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
In my young days of wild delight
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
In old age life is weariness!”
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
In one he doth accounts behold,
In one of thine enchanting lays
In one thing really did excel.
In order due the maidens pull;
In pages of a love narration
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
In rhyming I show laziness.
In Russ her love made manifest,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
In scenes like these it may be though,
Insensible her hand remains
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
Inseparable from our lot;
Inseparable soon they be.
Inseparable they remained.
In serious mood or dalliance
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
In silence shall I sit and yawn
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
In solid, unpretentious style,
In solitude or worldly din,
In some a willing martyrdom.
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Inspired but weariness intense;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
Inspired him with disgust and so
In spite of common sense we're wont
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
In springtime on the meadows green,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
In such an album with delight
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
Interrogation to denote.
In that morass where you and I
In the beginning, cold and mute,
In the beginning of this lay,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
In the dawn of existence drear.
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In the first place, say, am I right?
In the French language perfectly,
In their sterility of prattle,
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
In the recesses what hath stirred
In the unfettered hours of leisure
In the unmoved, magnificent
In the world's mortal revelries,
In the world's vortex my success,
In this case quite mistaken was.
In this the love of the fair sex
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In thy imagination warm,
In time I'll give ye without fail
In times gone by thy bare command-”
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Into delicious bondage gave
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Into the chamber where he slept
Into the cups already sped
Into the district then to boot
Into the lonely house she went,
Into the starry night extend.
Into the study of the boy
Into the tangled garden goes
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Introduce verse in conversation.
In true interpretation hates:
In truth he had the happy trick
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In vain was youth by us received,
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
Invigorate imagination
In what he merely acquiesced.
In whispers low the neighbours said:
In winter by its blank and dim
In winter on the fender bright,
In winter time would often come.
In winter, when Night longer holds
In worldly din or solitude
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
In your young days and also mine),
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I on my chosen hero dote;
I owe the censorship a little.
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
I promised!-Did I so?-Well, there!
I sail upon my lake at times
I say without poetic phrase,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Is ever ready to proclaim
Is ever ready with relief,
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
Is full of frigid jealousy,
"I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
"Is he known to you?”-"Yes and No.”
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Is it for long?”-"Ma chere cousine!”
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Is it that human restlessness
Is it that I am now compelled
I slumber much, a little read,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Is once again made manifest.
(I speak not of our poems here),
Is petted by the Emperor?-
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
"Is she in love?” quoth one. "With whom?
Is still condemned in love to be;
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
I still a complication view,
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
It carries of antiquity
It gradually possessed his mind;
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
I thank thee. In thy company,
I then resolved my heart to tear;
I the same admonition make.
I thought-retirement, liberty,
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
It may be, I yield nutriment!
It may be that his martyred shade
It may be that I did proceed-
It may be ye were born, or there
It now to investigate is time,
It occupied him from a boy,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
I tried when I began this tale,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Its driver seated on the rim
Its ebullition foaming white
Its insignificance I know
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Its splendour and its blandishments,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
It wakens in my breast again.
It was a cheery, generous
It whiled his idle hours away
It will be by a mob beset
I uttered to my lady fair
Ivan Petròvitch still a gaby,
I've had to make for having friends!
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
I've wasted in amusements vain,
I was for calm existence made,
I was half silly with affright.
I was incensed and he was sad.
"I weep. And if within your breast
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
I will with thy divinity
"I with my friend intend to fight!”
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
I would desire my bride to be-
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
I would not part with finally;
I would your vigilance arouse,
I write, and anguish flies away,
I write to you! Is more required?
I yield for splendid vanities,
I yield the fruit of work severe.
I yield with a low reverence;
Jackdaws on every spire-in scores.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Jealousy and vexation took
Jilted-glad of a holiday.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Just as he entered. How severe!
Just at a moment which I grieve
Just at that time his father died,
Just at the hour we designate
Just at this moment I cannot.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Just manages a feeble trot
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Known unto children perfectly:
Know that thy face that day I see.
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Kvass needful was to them as air;
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Laid down his life of sun and storm
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Latest arrivals' salutations,
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Lay languishing both day and night-
Lead into good society,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Learn to possess more self-control.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Lenski as a good match received,-
Lenski at intervals would dare,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Lessons to give he understood!
Lest jaded with satiety,
Lest the malicious reader or
Lest the world or her lord divine
Let me explain that in my song
Let me present ye to the man,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Let us congratulations pay
Let us go seek a little rest-
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Like a full moon magnificent.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Like him renouncing vanity,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Like his, her dress was always nice,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Like Leonora did she ride
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
(Like other things I could relate)
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown-
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Likewise an epitaph with tears
Like you and me and all the rest?-
Listen to me without disdain.
Listless is she the livelong day
List! the snow crunches-he draws nigh!
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Lo! in my garden was she found
Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Long ago?”-"'Tis the second year.”
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Longer the East inert reclines
Long in this fashionable cell
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Long, long the hour had past when home
Long since I held thee at the font-
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Long time her young imagination
Long time in meditation deep
Longtime was her heart desolate
Long tortured by his lay divine,
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Look through the window and kill flies.
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Lost in the hamlet far away.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Love's tender transports and distress,
Love to idealize inclined;
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Lo! with what pride celestial
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Made revelations undesigned,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Maidens before her meekly move
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Make up your mind to go there.”-"Ah!
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Malignant fury they disclose,
Man-forty years long in this wise-
Many an ancient legend which
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
May be that I by heaven's decrees
May be the empire of the sense,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
May well in innocence impart.
May yet be studious of his nails;
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Meantime in matutinal dress
Meantime Oneguine's apparition
Measured with great exactitude.
(Mechanically, let us add),
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Meet punishment for him provide.
Men become friends from idleness.
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
Men love no more, as only the
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Me now, inflict upon me pain?-
Men will forget me, but my urn
Merciful God, what will he deem?”
Method was dear unto his heart
Metreless verses recognizing
"Me?”-"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
Me your perfections would not bless;
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
"Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Minutely I will now portray.
Miraculously fair arise,
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Moina recalls for this alone
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
"Monsieur l'Abbe” a starving Gaul,
Morality taught scarce at all;
More advantageously appear
More blooming than the Boreal flame
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
More crimson every moment they.
More satisfaction to her taste.
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
More timid than a doe long chased,
More troublesome than usual?”-"No!
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Most by this circumstance offended
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Most usually a Cossack horse
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Mournful is thine approach to me,
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Must be pronounced unfortunate-
Must bow in common courtesy;
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Must take a walk and rest a bit-
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
My beauty, thou art ready too.
"My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.
My country and an exile's lot;
My country's honour and repute
"My darling child, thou art in pain.-
"My darling, growing old am I!
My days of life approach their end,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
My famous portrait indicate
My friends, the poet ye regret!
My friends, what means this odd digression?
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My gratitude do not disdain,
My guardian angel to the grave.
My heart of old would captivate.
My heart's allegiance can resign,
"My heart's delight, thou art not well.”-
My heart with but one look revive;
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
My image hath not disappeared,
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
My light productions to retain,
My little book. With thee I knew
My lot is fixed-with thoughtlessness
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My memory wandered wide and sought
My morning birdie, yesternight
My mother-in-law who lately died
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
My pen no longer finds delight,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My pretty self-deceiving maid-
My scholar without aptitude
"My second!” cried in turn Eugene,
My soul I cannot renovate-
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My spirit with such pangs before.
My splendid house and gaieties-
My sportive Muse I used to take
Mysteriously all objects near
My sum of happiness contained;
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
My unpretending page shall fill,
My venerated reader, oh!
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
My very latest composition!
My word of honour given have I.
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Napoleon tarried till it please
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Nay, near-but destiny decreed-
Nearer they come-Eugene appears!
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Near Khariton's in a side street
Near young Tattiana resident,
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Never for me to reappear-
Never upon my heroine
Next Saturday. The Larina
Night separated from her spouse,
No answer all that day was borne.
No answer! He another sent.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
No coquetry was there, I vouch-
No, ever to behold your face,
No fond illusions live to soothe,
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
No greater pleasure can exist
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
No longer through her former home;
"No matter, look immediately.
"No misery I see in that”-
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more remembered him; unto
No more the music thunders loud,
No more the village knows his face,
No more with pale Diana's rays,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
None could a trace of that impute,
None could her beautiful declare,
None the conviction could withstand
No, never in the early blaze
No novelty-is it not true?-
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
No obstacle of which I know.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one my anguish comprehends,
No one the contrary will urge,
No other book had time to read.
No other than Oneguine mine.
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Nor discontinued to distress
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor further comment that night made.
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
No senseless fashionable lay
No sense was ever manifest
No signs of trouble her accused,
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceed-
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
"Not at all.”-"That I can't conceive!
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Not even a poetic phrase,
Not high in general estimation;
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
"Not in the least, assured am I!”-
Not knowing its interpretation,
Not only sorrow-Ah! my dear,
No trace ye left in passing by
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Not so! My Moscow never went
Not that she had his works perused,
Not the least trace Oneguine sees
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Not to behave as he did once-
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Nought in the universe refused:
Nought of its charms original
November at the gate did stand.
Now all things round about repeat
Now a long branch itself entwined
Now, as in a deserted house,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Now I am ready to refuse.
Now it is ready to be sent-
Now, like hereditary foes,
Now of a family the head,
Now talkative, now reticent;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
Now with what eager interest
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
Obedient she had ever been
Obedient then to Nature's law,
Obedient to the magic strings,
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?-
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
Obsequious or indifferent!
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
O epic Muse, my powers increase
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
Of affectation innocent,
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Of all the guests within his mind.
Of a most mournful episode,
Of a strange night when the moon and-
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Of censure for the same incurred;
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Of "comme il faut.” Shishkòff, forgive!
Of consolation all bereft-
Of conversation, thought and aims-
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Of creditors a hungry rout
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
Of dreary Russia left behind,
O feet, where'er your path extends
Of error and the passions' strife.
Of every sort and every set!”-
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Of fiery youth's untutored days
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
Of foreign whims the impersonation-
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
Of friends the grateful intercourse-
Of friends unceremonious would
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Of her provincial innocence
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Of horn in circle call them round.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of languor and of love did tell
Of late I have been quite absurd,-
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Of life or death predestinate.
Of London life is "vulgar” called
Of love again, and yet again;
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of many an economic scheme;
Of migratory gipsy hordes-
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
Of modern Russians the disease.
Of my impassioned heroine.
Of my light paramour was proud.
Of old maids the divinity,
Of Olga he in song averred;
Of one thing till again we met.
Of passion reminiscences,
Of passion they so often raise.
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Of priceless value all things seem
Of roses to romancers dear;
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Of Russian domesticity;
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Of tender years the modesty
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of the commencement of the piece.
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Of the horizon she is like!”-
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
Of the night sentinels arise
Of the romances she preferred,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Of touching lightly every theme.
Oft staring through the window pane
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Of what he thought and what believed,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Of your perfections in my soul,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!”
Oh! I accept. And instantly
"Oh! I remember, where is he?”-
Oh, many a year hath run its course
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Old people's simple conversations
Old women at the coachmen swear.
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Olga began to long likewise
Olga he sees before his eyes
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Olga's admirer came that day:
Olga the tea must supervise-
Olga with trepidation dire.
"Olinka is her junior, see.
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
O Men, how very like ye are
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
On balls I madly used to dote,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
(One and the same thing it may be)
Oneguine acted very well
"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
Oneguine, bored to death again,
Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
Oneguine could not now submit,
Oneguine fired-Alas! alas!
Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
Oneguine his excuses says;
"Oneguine, I was younger then,
Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Oneguine meditative stood,
Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
Oneguine Olga bore away.
Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
Oneguine sat the table by
Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
Oneguine's letter!”-"Ah! the thing!
Oneguine's Letter to Tattiana
Oneguine slowly then began
Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
Oneguine-take him up again-
Oneguine-the beloved place
Oneguine then approached and said:
Oneguine to the window went
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like.”
Oneguine was a citizen
Oneguine was-so many deemed
Oneguine wasted; on my word,
Oneguine was the most impressed,
Oneguine went with trepidation
Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
One image occupied his mind,
One instrument for his own use-
One moment's slumber suffer not.
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
On everything around her gaze,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
On guests their servants used to wait
On him spleen mounted sentinel
On horseback every day they ride-
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
On innocent delights I dote,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
On lines invisible are fixt;
Only her countenance assumed
On melted wax in water poured;
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
On Sundays by yon window he,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
On the dull stage find all things changed,
On thee I used to meditate!
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
On this artistical retreat
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
On unknown female forms he throws.
On us beyond the grave attends,
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
On whom a sister's heart was set
On winters of the south a skit,
Opened the portals of the tomb
Opened with care, and entering bore
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
Opens unto her visitor.
Open the window-sit by me.”
Oppressive now is happiness,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Or any trifle else ye like
Or a professor in tulle cap.
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Or better,-like a faithful wife.
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
Or bosom full of languid fire,-
Or but for fame he saw the light;
Or by a card our homage pay,
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
Or counting on his uncle's death
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Or e'en the "Demon” of my strain.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Or even overcome by wrath
Or even, silent and resigned,
Or faults of grammar on its page-
Or for the solitary tomb
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Or "Idol mio,” and in the grate
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Original imagination,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Or innocently past me fly.
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Or letters of a maiden young.
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or, parable more flattering,
Or parody of modern ways?
Or quietly partake our woe.
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Or that adoring Grandison
Or the delivery of a note.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Or torturer malevolent?
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Or will my melancholy glance
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Other and colder thoughts affright,
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
Our liberty at least survives:
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Ourselves as unities to count;
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Our union would produce but grief.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Outlandish and provincial,
Outside descend the mists of night.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Page after page continued reading,
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Pallid and melancholy face,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Pardon I ask for such a sin-
Paris and Menelaus right.
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Passed into dull eternity,
Passes the torrent But alack!
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Past palaces and nunneries,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Pedantic although scholar like,
Pelagie Nikolavna has
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Perchance one more affectionate.
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
Perchance they laurels also cull-
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!”-
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Petòushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Petòushkoff, the provincial swell;
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Philanthropist or patriot,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Placed at the customary range;
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Poetical enthusiast,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Poetic transport. They impart
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
"Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Portrayed contemporary man
Portray the solitary den
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Possession hath no power to please,
Possess my love and sympathy.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Pray is it not a tough affair
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Present me.”-"You are joking.”-"No.”-
Presents her quarto amiably,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Priams of country populations
"Princesse, mon ange!”-"Pachette!”-
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Providence otherwise may deem-
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Quick to the country let us wend
Quite a sensation; the position
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Raged round him and of balked desire!
Raises within my breast as oft
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Rebuffed-as quickly reassured,
Received him freely at her house,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Regained authority awhile,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Relate some ancient history.”
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Removed her to his country seat,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
Repentance wields not now her spell
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Repose in peace, thou child of song.”
Rescue me from oblivion.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Resounding through all ages might
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Returning, from his ship amid
Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Rings from a dish of water full
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Romance of love I pray refer,
Romances pleased her from the first,
Romances three, in which ye scan
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Round which revolves the universe.
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Russia's Terpsichore review
Said something in an undertone
Sailed silently in unison-
Sails her allotted course on high,
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Scornfully challenged you afield-
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Secure in rural quietude-
Sed alia tempora. And bravery
Seductive, animated, bright,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
See, I can hardly crawl about-
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Seek the forgotten countenance
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
(See the first canto if ye will),
Selfish nonentities around?
Serious endeavours to assure
Servant of God and brigadier,
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
Shall I behold thee once again?”-
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Shall my declining years beguile;
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
"Shall we commence?”-"Let it be so,”
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
She brought with her the gift of song.
She buries deep within her breast
She calm and unconcerned appears.
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She cannot-Eugene oped the door
She cannot-then impatiently
She comprehends. The simple maid
She consolation thence obtained-
She could not sleep in her new bed.
She deemed its outline might afford.
She did not think "procrastination
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
She enters a deserted yard-
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She fears she cannot.-Cannot? Why?-
She found herself alone at last,
She from the winter corn espies
She gazed-a cue, forgotten long,
She gazed around her-it was day.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She got a book of nursery tales,
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She hears of conversation nought
She hears the bear behind her press,
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown-
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She is an angel! We sometime
She led me through nocturnal mist
She leisurely away doth ride,
She loved upon the balcony
She mourned and to the moon would raise
She murmurs in an undertone
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
She nerves herself from her alarm
She never more his face may view,
She never of deception dreamed
She on the apparition gazed,
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She promised Eugene, or she would
She rose-departed. But Eugene
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
She sank.-"He's here! Eugene is here!
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
She seeks the garden in her need-
She seemed of him oblivious,
She sits alone-'tis ever she!
She soon forgot, began to call
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She strains her throat to force a cry-
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
She the acquaintances she loves,
She the delicious novel reads,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
She visited the humble tents
She waited for-I don't know whom!
She waits, on fire her trembling frame-
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
She was as heedless and as gay-
She was thus fond of Richardson
"She who with melancholy face
She will not see, she will not hear.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
She would pronounce a la Francaise;
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Shines in the female firmament
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
Should be respected throughout life
Should dearly like a dance again.
Should go, the market for a maid,
Should make me much more circumspect,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
Shy, silent did the maid appear
Sickness more courage doth command
Sighs on another than her lord
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Since Eugene in that solitude
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Since in these arms I thee did bear-
Since leisure was together spent,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Singing inside her hut the maid
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Sits down and gazes on all sides-
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
So ardently did I desire
So be it! But internal strife
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Society endures not such!
Society he duped enow.”
Society renounced once more.
So frequently his mind would stray
So from the mountain lazily
So full of piety, correct,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
So inaccessible to men,
So irremissible appear?
So let us to the ball-room haste,
So many neighbours here exist-
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Some a mazurka occupies,
So meantime let him joyous live
Some are afar and some are dead.
Some army poet therein may
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
Some future ignoramus shall
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Some nice instructive novel read,
Some one or other editor
Some other long-departed Spring,
Some Russian authors he perused-
Sometime collected, shall relate
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Some wretched journal in his hand;
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit-
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail-
So she her silken sash unlaced,
So she in French herself expressed.
So Tania to her heart's content
So there will be a dance to-night.
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
(So 'twas with us in former years,
So uncongenial to my mind,
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
So, when he came next day to call,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Spared him not their asperities.
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Spoiled children most degenerate
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Still certain authors, I may add,
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Still everywhere, without, within,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Still of his club he member was-
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Straight for the entrance then he made
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Straight from their province had he come?”-
Strange unto her each childish game,
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Striking the intellect with awe
Struck Lenski dead-across the scene
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Subscribed, toujours a vous, Annette;
Successfully to please her tried,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Such is the country custom good;
Such open-hearted innocence.
Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Suddenly to the left hand side,
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Surely ye all have overhauled
(Surely you know him as I speak);
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,”
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Take to their wings and fly away.
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Tania doth by the casement linger
"Tania, my eldest child, you know”-
Tania, observed by nobody,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Tania well nigh expired when he
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick-
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
Tattiana certainly infers
Tattiana courage doth regain
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Tattiana every day conferred
Tattiana faltered, and became
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tattiana gently led them there.
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Tattiana in the yard appears
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in traditions old
Tattiana learns the intelligence-
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana motionless abides.
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”-
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
Tattiana's letter I possess,
Tattiana's Letter to Oneguine
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Tattiana-thus the sex is born.-
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Tattiana to the index flies
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Tattiana was her appellation.
Tattiana with impatience waited
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Tattiana would have gladly heard
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
Tender and elevated, free?
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
Terpsichore alone among
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
Terror assails her. Hastily
Terror of guardians of the night;
Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Than one's own fascinating self.
That a friend's arm in every case
That afterwards with evil smile
That all may hear his voice's tone.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
That certain volumes she might read.
That chosen heroes consecrate,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That every morn at Verrey's cost
That first the Muse appeared to me.
That for that matter in my verse
That, for the century designed,
That girl-but he must dreaming be-
That girl whom once on a time he
That glimmered through the radiant night
That grandmothers and grandsires may
That guests approach: and when above
That heart with inspiration sweet
That Heaven her character had blent
That hero, though his merit shone,
That he was "ready any day.”
That I am rich, a prince's wife?-
That I forget not whom I sing.
That is, he could elucidate
That I to you reveal my mind?
That like a friendly voice its tone
That mediocrity alone
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
That my dishonour would ensure
That Nina's marble symmetry,
That our desires which noblest seemed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
That the two friends with morning's light
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
That until Christmas comes again
That vanished are my youthful days
That vicious set whom I don't blame-
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That we her constantly betrayed
That year the autumn season late
That youthful heart-"But, now at least,
The accents wild of other's woes,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The aged nurse in ample gown,
The aged woman in her woe:
The all-entrancing joys of love-
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The amatory science warm,
The ancient barshtchina replaced
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The artful prisoner should seek
The artifice of villany-
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The ball in all its splendour shone.
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
The bard his answer waits at home,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bays of age and helplessness.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The blessings of humanity.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The body they consigned to rest,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The break of day she doth not see,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The butt of scandal having been,
The calm existence which I prize
The captain of a company.
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The channel of the river stilled
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The child of sloth and liberty.
The china teapot too ye might
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
The clue unto some mystery
The coach before a house stood still.
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
The company deep silence guard.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The connoisseur his glances throws
The contact of the foot I raised
The conversation tedious
The conversation was revived
The converse of our hermits twain,
The converse of the world polite,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The country hath its liberties
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The crash of music, candles' glare
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The crystals of her vestibule
The curs away to kennel chase,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The cynosure of every eye.
The damsel under escort place.
"The date, his fleeting years how long-
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The days of love and of romance!
The days which to your youth belong?
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The deuce with my inside has played.”
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
The disenchanted glass direct
The door flew open-Olga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The drama of my youth was played.
The dream left terror in its train.
The drive becomes monotonous-
The drum already doth arouse.
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The early tinkling of the bells
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The epitaph on marble shows:
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The eyes of a grave general.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The fair of the next generation,
"The family are all quite well-
The family of children hie.
The family of Kharlikoff,
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal hour had come at last-
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
The fated nutriment desired;
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fervid poet would recite,
The fever of the blood to slake-
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The fires of passion and its smart-
The firmament in mellow light,
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The fisher's fire afar illumes
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The forests in mysterious gloom
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The friend of liberty and laws
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The frolics of maidens.
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The general who accompanies.
The German baker looks around
The giddy world at last shall see.
The gifted songster never swerved,
The gilding of life's vanities,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The glass unwittingly inspect
The goblet still is bubbling bright-
The goddess would a masquerade
The God of Love is after you!
The golden ember now enshrines,
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The guests make room; aside each takes
The gulf between them was so vast,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The happiest days of life employ?
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
The hero's name too in advance,
The hero we immortalize.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The hostess doth interrogate:
The hours once more Oneguine counts,
The hour when-Fate so willed-we met
The house and garden I would see.”
The household property contain:
The household troop of little boys,
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
The husband comes and interferes
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The imagination to enliven
The indignation of her heart!
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The "in memoriam” pages sought,
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their Jealousy and separation
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their slander e'en was weariness;
Their voices nought to her impart
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The lady's glance upon him fell-
The lamps illuminating shine;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The language of her girlish pleading
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The Larinas unwisely went,
The Larinas were since sunrise
The Larinas would celebrate,
The last poor obol I was worth-
The laws of generations past,
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?”-
The less we love a lady fair
The letter is the thing, you see,-
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The lily's stem to eat away,
The limits of enlightenment
The little solitary nook
The lively trash of stories long
The lonely mansion-house to screen
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”-
The Lord deliver her and save!
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The Lovelaces are out of date,
The maiden at her casement sits
The Maidens' Song
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
The maids beside Tattiana keep-
The maid whose note he still possessed
The malady of hopeless love
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The manners of the highest class
The master always used to sit.
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The matter did not agitate,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
The medium is required of gold.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The memory of the bard was driven
The men salute with lower bows
The military band will play.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The moderns of the ancients rave-
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The monsters of the British Muse
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining night-
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The most industrious man alive
The motley moving mass and bright,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.
"Then amongst strangers I was left-
The native Russian tongue impeach?
The natural fickleness of passion,
Then became busy with the house,
Then be it so! My destiny
"Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
Then dressed himself...
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Then glittering in the sun descends.
Then handed her the song with grace.
Then he'd malign them secretly
Then, her distraction to allay,
The nightingale there all night long,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The nights of golden Italy
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
Then in the silent cabinet
Then, I say truly, none but thee
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
"Then send your grandson quietly
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then, the far capital forgot,
Then, then-well, in some solitude
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn
Then touching Olga they depart
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then ye were barely generous,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The olden time shall be my theme.
The old man who has had his freaks,
The opportunity is flown.
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The pall of night was growing thin,
The Paris of those country parts
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
The path of hope and tender fear-
The path which leads to glory's goal.
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The peasants there are rich as kings,
The perfidies I recollect
The pervert world with icy chill
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
The poet fell; already men
The poet from Tamboff secured,
The poet, modest though so grand,
The poet's fervid conversation
The poet's hour hath sounded-See!
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
"The post hath kept him, it is like.”
The powder in the pan is laid,
The prejudices all men have,
The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
The princess from the sofa cried
The Princess N. will be at home
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
There an imperious skeleton;
The reaping girls approach and ply
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
There came a sudden flash of light,
There Didelot became glorious,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There, in that knot of company,
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
The remnant destiny concedes,
Thereon the passing traveller read:
There our Katenine did revive
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
There, when the rains of spring we mark
The rigour of cold pride and all
The riot of the world and glare
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
The river through the linden wood.
The room my former master used.
The Russian language I deem vile
The Russian N with nasal sound
The Russian winter did adore
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly;
These are your relatives, believe:
The secrets of maidens.
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
These evenings as in days of old
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
These take their seats; the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
The shining orbs of night appear;
The shining pistols are uncased,
The shining river clothed in ice;
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open; to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitaph-a tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine;
The snow descends and buries all,
The snows from off the hills around
The snow upon the streets doth melt-
The solstice of our earthly years,
The sorrows of a single state.
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
The starry beacons fade away,
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The steward sent a note to tell
The stomach doth admonish us.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
The story of his young love's dream,
The story of thy life and fate.
The strange apartment her oppressed:
The strife grew furious and Eugene
The style in which my hero dressed;
The style of wise antiquity.
The sudden rattling of a car.
The sum of my existence gone
The sun had mounted high his steep,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
The table with its lamp unlit,
The tale of these romantic men;
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogs-
The time for mystic strolls which late
The time when Melancholy's claw
The tiny sun shone less on high
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.
The troop of apparitions fled,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,
The two friends' compliments she hears
The two old ladies then embraced
The unaffected traits she now
The unbidden guests he roughly chides-
The uncontaminated kiss
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
The venerable dame opined
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The very morning of our days.
The vestibule finds empty quite-
The vile seducer shall not dare
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight
The weary way still incomplete,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
The windows whitened, shutters close-
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The witching light of sympathy;
The wit of others to acquire.
The wolf upon the highways bold
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
The wood she enters-bear behind,-
The woods, still naked to the view,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
The workpeople she superintended,
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The world enough. Congratulate
The world is ever altering!
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smile-
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bit-they scandalise-
They hand in hand to table go.
They have invited you this week.”
They in a peaceful life preserved
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expected-
They made him feel inclined to doze;
They may forget that we exist.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
"The younger, you're in love with her!”
The young proprietor we find;
The young Simeonova too there
The youthful lover once again
The youthful poet's fond confession.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
They sat, but conversation's flow
They sent their compliments-but oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
They were the wonderful traditions
They will receive us with delight.”
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
They would not solemnly debate
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Thine honour is my countersign!
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
Thinking to float upon the stream,
This anchorite amid his waste
(This by command; for it was found,
This evanescent boyish bliss.
This gentle daring who could guess?
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
This great discovery relief
This he believed: a kindred spirit
This is my master's sitting-room.
(This joking I used to protest),
This life in masquerade concealed,
This lot in life with stern decree?
This monument of thought profound
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This northern summer of our own,
This separated us as well-
This, this were true felicity!
This was his social character.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
This world. I do not praise desire,
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Thither in future to proceed
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Thou also, my ideal true,
Thou also, reader generous,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Though around honoured Priam's throne
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though by an error and unsought-
(Though certainly mankind he knew
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though I'll return to him right early,
Though late, have a beginning made.
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather;
Though the foul vision promise made
Though to the Academy I come
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Though without palaces and streets,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Thrice happy who their agonies
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Through dense aristocratic rows
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus in a style obscure and stale,
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus oft-this I myself confess-
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
Thus to assassinate the eve?”-
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thus we began our little tale-
Thus widely meditation erred,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantation-
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till January fell no snow-
Till morn-life uniform but gay,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Till proper rings could be procured.
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Time was, a valiant general might
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time was, in style magniloquent
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
Time was, the poet's tender quill
Time was, two maidens from their home
Time was when cold seduction strove
Time will the ravages efface-
Time without me will lessons give,
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Tiresome unto her hath become
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
'Tis dreadful-ye agree, I hope-
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
'Tis fearful to anticipate
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
"'Tis habit, Lenski.”-"Is your ill
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
'Tis silent-on her shines the moon-
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
'Tis there that arrant fops display
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
'Tis time she to the altar went!
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
'Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”
Titles and ages intermixed.
To accompany him and to escort
To agitate me in my dreams.
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
To all she answers cruelly-
To an assembly-she appeared
To anticipate the break of day,
To arid selfishness resigned,
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
To array himself in evening dress.
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To ask her name the trouble took.
To a surrender gave consent,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
To banish far unworthy themes
To be a charming mystery:
To bear love's parching agonies-
To be in conversation clear
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To burn, yet reason keep awake
To captivate her how devoted!
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fair-
To classicism I've homage paid,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To consanguineous dinners they
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
To crush me with a just disdain.
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
To dire contentment shall give birth
To dominate her worthy lord,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
To dream upon the sunny strand
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
To ease the anguish of my breast.
To end with him her path below.
To Eve the universal mother,
To fawn upon and love express;
To find in gossip such delight,
To flight before her radiant look,
To follow you in every place,
To foreign lands he would allude,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
To friendship making no pretence,
Together moments one or two
Together they returned, nor word
Together we have wandered o'er
To God eternal hymns of praise.
To guess how you the eve pull through.”-
To happiness contributing.
To help her to the other shore
To her an elegy composed.
To his Penates now returned,
To idle musing was a prey;
To jest as he had done last eve,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
To labour in his sledge forgot,
"To-?”-"Larina.”-"Tattiana?”-"So.
To lawless love I should prefer-
To lay two covers secretly.
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
To light had brought them from their dust,
To listen to the rippling rill.
To listen to the words you speak,
To loiter there in idleness
To look on life as on a show,
To Love all ages lowly bend,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To make wise men the idiot play
To male acquaintances he bows,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
To me he would his Olga give,
To mention the foregoing eve,
Tome of "Malvina,” and but three
To-morrow before break of day,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
To move in fashionable life,
To mutter her concealed desire
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Took aim-but as immediately
To Olga frequently he would
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
To our Tattiana conquering,
To part in amity with thee!
To pass the night at home hath gone.
To pass with reasonable men
To peer into the future tries.
To purest love he tuned his note
To raise a clamour and a din:
To raise his pistol to his eye,
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
To russify the foreign phrase
To Russ indigenous are not;
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
To secrets of virgins,
To see aught-never mind meanwhile)
To see his Olga ere the fray-
To seek him out with bended head.
To see you by our fireside stand,
To shallow sentiment a slave!
To sigh and meditate alone:
To sketch myself that I have tried
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
To slay himself with blade or ball,
To standards in which we believe?
To stay the maid against her will.
To strike imagination serve.
To such-delightful to repel.
To swagger as the art of love,
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To take this letter to O- Well!
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To the assembly her they bear.
To the fair object of his dream,
To the impressions of our youth,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the sarcastic observation,
To the theatre he repairs
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the youth Eugene hurried now-
To this arrangement can be seen,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
To understand by slow degrees
To vary for a few brief days.
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To visit Moscow in the season.
To wander through the meadows still,
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
To what malicious merriment,
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
To whom are our misfortunes grief
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
To whom we used to consecrate
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,-
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
To write his forefathers to warn
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To write of any other elf
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
Transported to our Russian clime.
Trembles at artificial shame.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,-
Trembling he seeks the young princess-
Triquet arose, and for the bard
Triumphant by anticipation,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Triumphs-their own or those of friends-
Troy's sages should in concert own
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Turned to her and discordantly
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
'Twas plain-an oaken floor ye scan,
"'Twas possible then, happiness-
'Twas she who first within his breast
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
'Twas these he read and these alone
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
Two dressed in uniform appear-
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
Two poles together glued by ice,
'Twould serve ye in an epigram-
Two verses he could recollect
Undeviating and insane
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Undressed herself and went to bed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Unfavourable unto her.
Unhappily too salt by far;
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Unknown to all, without a tie,
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Until her heart less high should bound
Until her powers of running fail.
Until the sleepless Breguet chime
Unto a carping world must show-
Unto Anicia for the keys
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Unto her husband, went away-
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell-
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Unto the gates the servants fly
Unto the hero of this lay
Unto their solitude one day,
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Unto the windmill he must ride
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?-
Upon her brow sits wrath alone-
Upon her cheek by adulation
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Upon his couch insensibly;
Upon its damp opacity,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Upon the highway of the sea
Upon the meadows showering,
Upon the opening page ye find:
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Upon the table in a trice
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Upon the windows tracery,
Upon those margins she perceived
Upon those pages she descries
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Up to the attic, and all need
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Us from the world wherein we live.
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Variety of speech and vests,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Vice in romance is glorified
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Villages in the distance show
Virgins miraculous I see,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Vladimir closes up his book,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
"Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Vladimir Lenski visited
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
Vladimir something curtly said
Vladimir's property, a man
Vociferously paid her court,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Waiting his coming-his alone!
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Wallow, my friends, in company!
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
"Warm yourself here a little space!”
Was a delightful little spot,
Was born beside the Neva, where
Was certainly no Grandison.
Was certainly not erudite
Was drawn, ideal of my lay-
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Was he in health and void of care?-
Was it not so?-for thee I gave,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
Was nothing but the British spleen
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Was that which we are wont to call
Was the first question Olga made,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook-
Was withered ere the morning light-
Was with himself dissatisfied.
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Was younger than myself, my light,
We all of us of education
We are the first who such a name
Wearied of leisure in the end,
We called to mind our youthful days-
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
We glide along a floor of wax.
We hear with interest intense
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
"Well!”-"I the elder should prefer,
Well! just as she was yesterday.
Well known unto Oneguine mine.
Well! Larina appears to us
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
We must admit but little taste
"We never loved in days of old,
Were I like you a bard by trade-
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Were to analysis subjected.
Were you in love when you were young?”-
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
We Russians, friends from distant parts
We visit about Christmas Day,
What acrimonious scorn I trace
What agitation languidly
"What ails thee, dear?”-"I feel depressed.
"What ails thee?”-"Nothing.”-He is fled.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What a storm of emotions keen
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
What boots it with the age to strive?
"What can be done? She is no child!”
"What can be drearier than the house,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known;
"What! Grandison?”-"Yes, certainly!”
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What I by relatives conceive?
What, invitations? The same day
What is his latest character?
What is thy cleverness to me?
"What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What more's required? The world replies,
What never was remarked or heard
What once I knew is clean forgot-
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What say you? to the family-
What they in conversation said?-
What visions then her fancy thronged-
What will the coming dawn reveal?
When all around the entrance pressed,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When but a boy he Olga loved
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Whene'er he had an aching head;
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
When first upon my cheek I feel
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
When he in ardent verse portrays
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
When in as instant she is lost,-
When in her walks abroad she met
When in simplicity ye wrote
When in that company she saw
When in the grand saloon was heard
When in the study's calm retreat,
When I yon semicircle bright
When motionless your gaze beneath
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
When on the pallid eastern sky
When Passion's fire no longer glows
When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When separation's hour drew nigh,
When shall I wing my passage free
When, sitting by his fire alone
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
When the hour came to bid good-bye-
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When the sonorous Breguet tells
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When, where, and in what desert land,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When will the devil take his own!”
When, wise at length, we seek repose
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
Where all upon the surface lies,-
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Wherefore am I your quarry held?-
Wherefore regarding him express
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Where I can no more recollect?-
Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get;
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,-
Where the first time she met with him.
Whereto in language courteous
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where-”-"What! another eclogue spin?
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Which in the winter were a joy:
Which in your spirit dominates,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Which might for many ages last.
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
Which never have existed, e'en
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
Which of approaching labour tells
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Which we experienced long ago.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
Whilst he "belle Nina” had the face
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whither at headlong speed doth go
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”-
Whither departed is the host?
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither that evening he will go.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Who by a haughty word or glance
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who early died a gallant death,”
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who following Petrarch move along
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who had for four long years survived
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Who in the agony of grief
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Who in thy love finds more delight
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?”-
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
Who labours hard to humour us?
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whom latterly one often meets
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes-
Whom thirty centuries adore.
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
"Who will be there?”-"The family.
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who without more prevarication
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”-
Who words and actions will adjust
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
Who would the maiden innocent
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
"Why did you leave last night so soon?”
Why did you visit our poor place?
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?-
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will happiness replace. My God!
Will he pursue?-But no one came.
Will not five centuries exceed
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass; the same to-morrow try-
Will sound an insult in your ear.
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Will you?”-"Agreed.”-"I thank you, friend,”
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winter's approach she doth not hail
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
With affectation,-nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With an imagination wild,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome;
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blessings on the ditches and
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With cherries, red currants,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With dance and with song.
With deeper woe than others' grief.
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With Eugene pranks of former years
With eye precise and without fail.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With great delight.-O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With him were friends eternally:
With his exasperated sense,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With humble prose I'll fill my page
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
Within that secret court discussed,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With it may be a couple more;
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
With love which happiness extends;
With many a snare their pathway line!
With many a vacancy, 'tis said.”-
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With measured step and even gait
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With mute appeal to ask they seem-
With Olga; nor of this appeared
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
With our Oneguine doth aspire
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete;
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With raspberries, cherries.
With roses, caps and looks malign;
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With scandal's trivial ornament.
With serious air then went away
With shame I shudder and with dread-
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness;
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,-
With tears which secret sufferers love-
With tenderness hath recognized
With thee I conversed when I bore
With the epistle of my fair;
With the "Well-Wisher” in her hand!
With this immoderate request
With this unpleasant tete-a-tete,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tranquil air Oneguine leads
With tumult or contentment still
With unanimity complete,
With us is easily attained.
With us 'tis quite a novelty
With "vale” finish off a note;
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Would haste in agitation dire
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?”-
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and then-
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Yes, happy-though she at his side
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet I in idleness expend
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
You choose.”-"But who is she?”-"My wife.”
You fall in love again. But still-
"You have a letter to me sent.
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
You in the least commiserate
You know that I am now a fool-
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
You'll spend your winter famously!
You never since your nose have shown.
You never would have heard the name,
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Young maidens, fair maidens,
You o'er your wine insulted hath-
Your conversation cold and hard,
"Your fashionable world I hate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
"Your second you have left behind!”
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
You will not all abandon me.
You with stern countenance declare
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!”-
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,

THE RIGHT ENCYCLOPEDIA-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Upon the highway of the sea
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
At last the author!” cries Mamma.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
Oneguine's Letter to Tattiana
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Next Saturday. The Larina
Verses and tears et cetera.
Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Opened the portals of the tomb
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
Or for the solitary tomb
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The inmate is for ever dumb,
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
He found them in an almanac,
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And triumphs in career erotic.
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
Above the ashes of the dead.
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Some are afar and some are dead.
To seek him out with bended head.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
Whene'er he had an aching head;
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
All silently hung down his head.
And gently hovered o'er my head?
For patience, reader, I must plead!
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead-
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
With shame I shudder and with dread-
And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read;
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spread-
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
Attentive listened to the lad.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
He long should have been on the road.
Grant that I err not on the road.”
He dragged her by a forest road
An idle anchorite and sad,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
(Mechanically, let us add),
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear gone-she at the threshold placed;
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient barshtchina replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
At Larina's abode produced
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
It may be that I did proceed-
Not all will like myself proceed-
Thither in future to proceed
And cares not farther to proceed;
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Will not five centuries exceed
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
But I perceive thou dost not heed-”
He took no more the slightest heed;
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Up to the attic, and all need
She seeks the garden in her need-
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Had run across her path at speed,
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Nay, near-but destiny decreed-
From the moist cork the bottle freed
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
By visions who was ne'er deranged
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolonged-
What visions then her fancy thronged-
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And long perukes hath vanished.
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed-
Just at that time his father died,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
But now our minds are mystified
Was with himself dissatisfied.
But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
"Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
And a new diadem supplied.
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupied-
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
"I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
He conversation would have led-
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
"What ails thee?”-"Nothing.”-He is fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Of London life is "vulgar” called
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And with remorseful anguish filled,
As if with eider-down is filled.
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!”-
And heard a voice cry-Why! He's killed!-
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led-
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And to the field of honour led;
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?-
A few of different temper deemed,
Oneguine was-so many deemed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained-
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained;
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined;
At first for books was disinclined,
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
He on the conflagration frowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach; but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Another with cock's head appeared,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assembly-she appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
And Tania's husband soon appeared.-
For evermore had disappeared.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga; nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went not-sooner was prepared
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared-
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered;
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
By indolence and languor fired
Singing God knows what maid admired,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
In amorous flights when so inspired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
How like the billow I desired
The fated nutriment desired;
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred;
As Saadi anciently averred-
In the recesses what hath stirred
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred;
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured;
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffed-as quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
"What ails thee, dear?”-"I feel depressed.
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
Oneguine was the most impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused-
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
He ought to have conciliated
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Nor long his mind was agitated
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Were to analysis subjected.
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected
They long at home have her expected-
His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
By Olga's hand distributed
And every year distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Of what he thought and what believed,
And she at last hath us deceived;
Lenski as a good match received,-
In vain was youth by us received,
Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
At an old aunt's they had arrived
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
For first "madame” his wants observed,
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed-
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In correspondence been allowed.
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
At prisoner's base she never played.
The deuce with my inside has played.”
The drama of my youth was played.
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?-
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
"What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And "Agathon” replied, amazed.
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized;
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid-
Remained with him the youthful maid.
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
To classicism I've homage paid,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Oneguine then approached and said:
Gazing into his face, she said:
"Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
What they in conversation said?-
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
With many a vacancy, 'tis said.”-
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
In mist profound all yet is hid.
Had rendered him an invalid;
Returning, from his ship amid
Wherefore am I your quarry held?-
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
As one who bivouacs afield,
Scornfully challenged you afield-
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
And can it be? But late a child
"What can be done? She is no child!”
An ardent heart and yet so mild?-
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
The wolf upon the highways bold
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
His mother from the door doth scold.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
How empires store of wealth unfold,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
"We never loved in days of old,
These evenings as in days of old
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Some marriageable maids behold,
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the suspicious veteran old,
Tattiana in traditions old
An almanac but eight years old.
In dreams and what the moon foretold
Had killed me had the like been told.”
Her Moscow cousin, often told
And the young ladies fortunes told,
Heard he the truth? And thus she could-
She promised Eugene, or she would
To Olga frequently he would
Of friends unceremonious would
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
Exist-that their immortal band
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
With the "Well-Wisher” in her hand!
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her foot was in my other hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A weary season was at hand-
Of Africa, ancestral land,
The ruts of his own fatherland.
With thoughts of a far distant land,
When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
And in the bathroom did command
In times gone by thy bare command-”
Sickness more courage doth command
Of a strange night when the moon and-
The poet, modest though so grand,
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
To dream upon the sunny strand
With blessings on the ditches and
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand-
November at the gate did stand.
To see you by our fireside stand,
None the conviction could withstand
Immersed in secret thought I stand
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Her tears flow plentifully and
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
A passionate desire to bend
To Love all ages lowly bend,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And had with waddling in the end
Charms more enduring in the end.
And thou, persistent to the end,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Are admirable, my dear friend,
In duel having killed his friend
Will you?”-"Agreed.”-"I thank you, friend,”
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
If not, the money I will lend.”
An ear to my confession lend;
Their natural attractions lend
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
And they the waters recommend.
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Yet I in idleness expend
My days of life approach their end,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Assistance ever will extend,
Farther Tattiana's walks extend-
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
But finally in wedlock bind.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
The young proprietor we find;
Upon the opening page ye find:
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
But what astonished do I find
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
The wood she enters-bear behind,-
Of dreary Russia left behind,
"Your second you have left behind!”
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Had perished a creative mind,
His immorality of mind
From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind;
Of all the guests within his mind.
Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?
So uncongenial to my mind,
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found-
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
(This by command; for it was found,
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Debate commanded ample food-
As to a worthy man and good!
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Such is the country custom good;
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Oneguine meditative stood,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.
A village and beneath, a wood,
Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
How I have erred and felt the rod!
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”-
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He was no more! The youthful bard
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
Tattiana would have gladly heard
And ought he not to disregard
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Your conversation cold and hard,
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
A young and handsome galliard.
What doth she see? Around the board
The company deep silence guard.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,”
She enters a deserted yard-
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Epistle second, note the third,
Whose qualities appeared to afford
She deemed its outline might afford.
Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Sighs on another than her lord
To dominate her worthy lord,
Command him not to say a word-
Reform me both in deed and word,
Together they returned, nor word
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Oneguine wasted; on my word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Of late I have been quite absurd,-
No more the music thunders loud,
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And never hath our language proud
Of my light paramour was proud.
Even as Moscow, city proud.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
That girl-but he must dreaming be-
But what a nuisance it will be,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
I would desire my bride to be-
Is still condemned in love to be;
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
And this fifth canto ought to be
As lordly mansions ought to be,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
As many entertainments be!
"Do not-you might-suspicious be;
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Or a swift meteor, may be,
(One and the same thing it may be)
Or reconciled them, it may be,
With worldly honours, it may be,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Inseparable soon they be.
Whilst he "belle Nina” had the face
Time will the ravages efface-
And physic bring with mournful face,
No, ever to behold your face,
I never should have seen your face
Where the first time I saw your face,-
But gazes on Oneguine's face
No more the village knows his face,
Pallid and melancholy face,
"She who with melancholy face
Depicted on your haughty face!
Oneguine-the beloved place
Bright blazed the window of the place,
By "belle Tattiana” to replace.
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
And then "monsieur” supplied her place;
Hard by the window took her place.”-
Why did you visit our poor place?
The damsel under escort place.
Drank to her health in the first place,
To follow you in every place,
And after them at headlong pace
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
"Warm yourself here a little space!”
At the front gates, but in brief space
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The boy was wild but full of grace.
An ancient lady full of grace.-
Then handed her the song with grace.
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
A print without the picture's grace,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Inheritor of all his race.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
For there he left a mournful trace.
And my Eugene the path must trace-
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
The shining river clothed in ice;
Like his, her dress was always nice,
But wherefore not?-'Tis pleasant, nice,
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Euphonious, though I know a spice
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
And the extent of his caprice;
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Upon the table in a trice
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
And his strange conduct at the dance
Again in her ethereal dance?
Before him her wild game of chance.
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Meeting you in times past by chance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
His momentary loving glance
God grant that all who herein glance,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Who by a haughty word or glance
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Or will my melancholy glance
Upon the stage his weary glance.
The days of love and of romance!
And in her hand a French romance.
Canto the First of this romance.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
When people with long countenance
Seek the forgotten countenance
He yawns, averts his countenance,
I heard thy voice's resonance
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
Then would we muse as in a trance,
The hero's name too in advance,
And views amongst themselves advance
Such open-hearted innocence.
Of her provincial innocence
Then to reward such confidence
Tattiana learns the intelligence-
Her amorous experience
He wanders in his indolence;
And natural benevolence,
And aimless journeys did commence-
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Habit would bring indifference.
I yield with a low reverence;
To friendship making no pretence,
I cannot tell on what pretence-
His energy and impotence.
But this adventure's consequence
I, after so much eloquence,
Not to behave as he did once-
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And yet oblivion forbade.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
It may be that his martyred shade
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
As in a thicket's humble shade,
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
Was the first question Olga made,
He whom we sing to shall be made
I was for calm existence made,
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though the foul vision promise made
Though late, have a beginning made.
But sad is the reflection made,
But no reply unto her made.
For our amusement ever made
Nor further comment that night made.
Whose heart experience icy made
A certain little escapade
They shovel silver with a spade,
The goddess would a masquerade
Choosing a profitable trade,
Were I like you a bard by trade-
But cannot anyhow evade
And what will Destiny concede?”
For ever faithful will abide.”
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
His fate shall presently decide.
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
But I am now another's bride-
Like Leonora did she ride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
She leisurely away doth ride,
"He promised here this day to ride,”
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A bearded postillion astride
Unto the windmill he must ride
On horseback every day they ride-
Mute glances interchanged aside
In consultation stand aside-
But now all doubt was set aside,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
And soon Oneguine's door beside
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
And glittering simpletons beside;
A pair of bullets-nought beside-
And hastened to his uncle's side,
Yes, happy-though she at his side
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
But grown familiar side by side
Found them in darkness side by side,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
Jaws are at work. On every side
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Always together, eventide
Meet punishment for him provide.
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
And death before the husband wide
And the saloon threw open wide;
Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Of a most mournful episode,
To foreign lands he would allude,
And unto whom we all allude
Deep in the distant province rude,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Secure in rural quietude-
Then, then-well, in some solitude
Before whom once in solitude,
Where long time he in solitude
Daily of love in solitude.
In worldly din or solitude
Since Eugene in that solitude
Fly frequent to my solitude,
My soul is filled with gratitude!
Measured with great exactitude.
Displayed a noble rectitude-
My scholar without aptitude
To part in amity with thee!
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
By Providence's dark decree!
This lot in life with stern decree?
Tender and elevated, free?
When shall I wing my passage free
From such digressions wholly free.
Impressed him in the least degree,-
Perchance he will to all the three.
Yet sometimes pages two or three
His valet brings him letters three.
Tome of "Malvina,” and but three
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
The poet's hour hath sounded-See!
The house and garden I would see.”
And a guitar produced we see,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing-see!
Virgins miraculous I see,
Know that thy face that day I see.
The giddy world at last shall see.
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
He usually was glad to see
"Olinka is her junior, see.
The break of day she doth not see,
The letter is the thing, you see,-
A mansion-by the window, see!
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
To move in fashionable life,
He in the early years of life
Who floats contentedly through life,
Commence a new career in life
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
And like his shadow dogged his life,
In many things had changed his life-
He knew not how to spend his life.
Should be respected throughout life
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
And leads a solitary life?
And rest from bygone days of strife.
So be it! But internal strife
In aimless ease and far from strife,
Of error and the passions' strife.
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
By every proper-minded wife,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Wherein the miserable wife
Or better,-like a faithful wife.
By children and by faithful wife
That I am rich, a prince's wife?-
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Without profession, business, wife,
You choose.”-"But who is she?”-"My wife.”
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
But at a later, sterile age,
In boston and the game of age,
And testy gamesters do engage
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Another could her heart engage,
A visionary personage
As once, to fill the rapid page
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Or faults of grammar on its page-
With humble prose I'll fill my page
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
As the reflection of his age,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Another could her woe assuage
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
For two whole days it seemed a change
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
Placed at the customary range;
No one the contrary will urge,
Again a century should scourge
Unto his own Tattiana he,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
That girl whom once on a time he
For empty sound the rascal swore he
A paragon of virtue he!
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Three mortal hours per diem he
Tania well nigh expired when he
And by a sweet delusion he
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
And in her native language she
And a half rubles down gave she;
Nor on the letter yet hath she
"Oh! I remember, where is he?”-
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And disappear in space; then she
She sits alone-'tis ever she!
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
And an encouragement did breathe
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
No fond illusions live to soothe,
A dying man with art to soothe,
Men love no more, as only the
On Sundays by yon window he,
Dressed like a London dandy he
Before you agonized to die-
And silently I here must die-
The family of children hie.
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Unknown to all, without a tie,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The fever of the blood to slake-
Her promptings unto law did make,
I the same admonition make.
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Acquaintance instantly to make.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Great sacrifices for his sake!
For law I far niente take
My sportive Muse I used to take
And every morning I awake
To burn, yet reason keep awake
Or any trifle else ye like
Pedantic although scholar like,
Of the horizon she is like!”-
"The post hath kept him, it is like.”
By computation) it is like
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like.”
The comrade of your youth should strike,
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Then suddenly discharge a joke
A bogy conjured up in joke,
And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followed-a light broke-
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Thus we began our little tale-
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Thus in a style obscure and stale,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
I know there's none more amiable.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
To see aught-never mind meanwhile)
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile-
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile;
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
About the rain and flax and cattle.”-
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
I owe the censorship a little.
But will not modify a tittle-
The crystals of her vestibule
Though correspondence as a rule
Careless of every social rule,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
In solid, unpretentious style,
And a romance in ancient style
The door flew open-Olga came,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
Because a member I became.
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
"And is it long since back he came?
Will he pursue?-But no one came.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces came-
Her shoulder-Olga swiftly came-
But turn we once more to our dame.
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
And comfort of each country dame,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.
By recklessness amuse or shame
Believe me, of my present shame
That vicious set whom I don't blame-
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
By love's inevitable flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
But fashionable hatred's flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame-
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
The old Derjavine noticed me,
His character attracted me.
And fled afar-she followed me.
Of many an economic scheme;
And my romance's open theme
The olden time shall be my theme.
And then the stanzas of my theme
Who reads his visionary theme
Of touching lightly every theme.
He with an innocence extreme
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
And, inspiration firing me,
Until the sleepless Breguet chime
Transported to our Russian clime.
And visit many a foreign clime,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
She is an angel! We sometime
For a protracted space of time.
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
It now to investigate is time,
How in the country pass this time?
And may fall headlong any time.
You will not all abandon me.
Despair and anger seize on me,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Tiresome unto her hath become
All dark and silent hath become;
Callous to all on earth become-
And shorter had the days become.
Straight from their province had he come?”-
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Though to the Academy I come
When will my hour of freedom come!
In winter time would often come.
Nor shall the caterpillar come
At eventide would hither come,
He wakes-they with a letter come-
Triumphant with the answer come.
To take a hand at whist oft come:
His name: the tenderness of home
Yes! for our unpretending home,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
Long, long the hour had past when home
No longer through her former home;
Time was, two maidens from their home
The Princess N. will be at home
Homeward returning, he at home
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
The bard his answer waits at home,
With better half as cumbersome;
That first the Muse appeared to me.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Mournful is thine approach to me,
But I-what is all this to me?
What is thy cleverness to me?
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”-
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
Open the window-sit by me.”
In the lone garden and the lane?
Oft staring through the window pane
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Undeviating and insane
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Struck Lenski dead-across the scene
But shall depict the touching scene
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
"My second!” cried in turn Eugene,
All this was novel to Eugene.
He was in error; for Eugene
"And is it,” meditates Eugene.
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
She rose-departed. But Eugene
And so departed. But Eugene,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Between myself and my Eugene,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
As a poetic life serene,
And irrigate them with champagne;
Are turned upon her. All combine
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
"Departed Lenski here to dine
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
Behold the dames who once were fine
A single being: 'twas in fine
The sneers of critics superfine;
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,-
And make a dark existence shine
The lamps illuminating shine;
He could in disputation shine
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”-
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
"Aline!”
Diminishes as years decline.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Corset and album and Pauline,
With many a snare their pathway line!
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
No other than Oneguine mine.
Well known unto Oneguine mine.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
In your young days and also mine),
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Of my impassioned heroine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Never upon my heroine
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
Is it for long?”-"Ma chere cousine!”
Tattiana's Letter to Oneguine
Lest the world or her lord divine
Before the dregs they shall divine
Another bard with art divine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Give me just half a glass of wine-
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine
With loud explosion, the bright wine
The sum of my existence gone
All to the grand saloon are gone-
To pass the night at home hath gone.
Can she have been a moment gone
The ball in all its splendour shone.
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
That hero, though his merit shone,
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Having for money's sake alone
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Certainly not Eugene alone
When, sitting by his fire alone
'Twas these he read and these alone
To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
In horror for itself alone,
Upon her brow sits wrath alone-
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
Waiting his coming-his alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Though around honoured Priam's throne
"Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.
Said something in an undertone
She murmurs in an undertone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
That all may hear his voice's tone.
That like a friendly voice its tone
But that the eyes of every one
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
No answer all that day was borne.
A constant harping on one tune,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
The aged woman in her woe:
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Or quietly partake our woe.
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
With taffety instead of crape.
Could in romantic mantle drape
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
'Tis dreadful-ye agree, I hope-
Had bid her sigh for without hope-
In country solitude you mope,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
His inner consciousness laid bare,
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Was he in health and void of care?-
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Albums magnificent which scare
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Lenski at intervals would dare,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare
O Men, how very like ye are
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
With Ozeroff was wont to share
And impiously should declare,
You with stern countenance declare
I cannot help it I declare,
None could her beautiful declare,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
The riot of the world and glare
The crash of music, candles' glare
And the more surely we ensnare
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Here I remark all poets are
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Which in the elevated sphere
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here.
"Abandon hope for ever here!”
She sank.-"He's here! Eugene is here!
(I speak not of our poems here),
And Eugene soon discovered there
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
With all their progeny were there,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
I promised!-Did I so?-Well, there!
Tattiana gently led them there.
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
And yet the city's flower was there,
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?”-
And lo! he is already there!
Was born beside the Neva, where
He bends his course to Talon's, where
Faces which we meet everywhere
And be not in advance severe.
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Just as he entered. How severe!
If the choice in my power were,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
And spouted it with lyric fire-
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,-
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
With our Oneguine doth aspire
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire;
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
So ardently did I desire
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire;
The wit of others to acquire.
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom thirty centuries adore.
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
He read as vainly as before,
My spirit with such pangs before.
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
How oft to the Crimean shore
To help her to the other shore
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
And thy protection I implore.
Society renounced once more.
With it may be a couple more;
With affectation,-nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore;
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
"But which, my dear?-In days of yore
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For long-for ever. To be sure
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
And after Albion's proud lyre
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,-
That a friend's arm in every case
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?”
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
Of modern Russians the disease.
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease;
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
In motley and amusing chase.
The curs away to kennel chase,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Not even a poetic phrase,
I say without poetic phrase,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Address to you one single phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
Who every gesture, every phrase
Eugene would speak regarding these.
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She would pronounce a la Francaise;
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bit-they scandalise-
Crushing and a confusing noise;
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
The Larinas were since sunrise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise-
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Man-forty years long in this wise-
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense;
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close-
"Command me, darling, what you choose”-
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse-
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
All visited him at first, of course;
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse-
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
But look you-ah! do not refuse.”
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
But I the products of my Muse,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use-
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
"What can be drearier than the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I married-now, I supplicate-
"Advance!”-Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
Both were expectant of the hate
"Your fashionable world I hate,
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
(Like other things I could relate)
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
"He hath neglected us of late.”-
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate;
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate-
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate-
By time (who can anticipate?)
'Tis fearful to anticipate
For evermore is separate.
The Larinas would celebrate,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,-
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate;
You in the least commiserate
Or "Idol mio,” and in the grate
His double sashes and his grate,
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
By an obrok's indulgent rate:
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
By rank as settled by the State.
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats; the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state;
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate-
"Me?”-"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete;
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,
With this unpleasant tete-a-tete,
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
The fervid poet would recite,
When poets lachrymose recite
Was certainly not erudite
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
A bottle of a vintage white
Winter resigned her empire white,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Its ebullition foaming white
All so distinct, and all so white!
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
Highways all Russia will unite
Happy who thereto can unite
The girl in marriage they unite.
Nor even tears afford respite,
I have endured without respite.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,-
A philosophic anchorite:
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
But I must add to what I write
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
Beyond this may attempt to write.
Serve who could neither read nor write.
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
And irritates the appetite.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
By Olga stood, dejected quite
A Russian household simple quite,
Affection how did you requite?
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
And town and friends forgotten quite.
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
The vestibule finds empty quite-
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Fond declarations they invite
On innocent delights I dote,
I on my chosen hero dote;
On balls I madly used to dote,
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
With "vale” finish off a note;
Or the delivery of a note.
Interrogation to denote.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Your innocent and charming note
A dagger, asterisk, or note
To purest love he tuned his note
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
When in simplicity ye wrote
And an elegiac poem wrote.
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
So let us to the ball-room haste,
And the attendants called in haste.
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
We must admit but little taste
All which in Paris eager taste,
More satisfaction to her taste.
And she despite herself would waste
And ease and fashionable waste,-
And education runs to waste,
This anchorite amid his waste
"Princesse, mon ange!”-"Pachette!”-
Subscribed, toujours a vous, Annette;
And the cast-iron statuette
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Device of rural minds acute!)
In the beginning, cold and mute,
From whose analysis minute
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
My country's honour and repute
None could a trace of that impute,
Her all in all did constitute;
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
He racked his brains to find its clue
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!”
His vanity first let us pique
Thou also, my ideal true,
Ah! it may be, affection true
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
No novelty-is it not true?-
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
I did not please you. Why pursue
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Without the faintest trace to leave
And all without her husband's leave.
But now our hero we must leave
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Into delicious bondage gave
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
But promise of our meeting gave,
Was it not so?-for thee I gave,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
Alarm the winter journey gave.
The prejudices all men have,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave-
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
He sang of love-to love a slave.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
A prudent man like you and brave
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
My guardian angel to the grave.
For him an honourable grave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But where Melpomene doth rave
The moderns of the ancients rave-
The Lord deliver her and save!
And thy inebriating wave
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Thus to assassinate the eve?”-
But my Oneguine the whole eve
To mention the foregoing eve,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
To standards in which we believe?
These are your relatives, believe:
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Just at a moment which I grieve
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
He called upon me Christmas Eve-
Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
To jest as he had done last eve,
I love you-to what end deceive?-
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
And that too often we receive
What I by relatives conceive?
"Not at all.”-"That I can't conceive!
His son is married, just conceive!”
In clouds of steam above perceive.
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To me he would his Olga give,
Of "comme il faut.” Shishkòff, forgive!
Time without me will lessons give,
But I await thee: scarce alive
The most industrious man alive
Us from the world wherein we live.
Would whisper: shall I so long live?”-
So meantime let him joyous live
Depart in peace and friendly live?
And our successors soon shall drive
Mutual destruction to contrive.
And yet he in your cause would strive
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
What boots it with the age to strive?
And loves you as-a relative!
Applause, the people's donative.
I can't translate the adjective.
There our Katenine did revive
My heart with but one look revive;
Along the hall, and high above
That guests approach: and when above
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
And enmity and hope and love-
Again the plague of boyhood-love?
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
The all-entrancing joys of love-
To swagger as the art of love,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
Extended-haunt which Dryads love.
By absence who hath chilled his love,
I love you with a brother's love,
With tears which secret sufferers love-
The malady of hopeless love
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Maidens before her meekly move
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
A thick immense neglected grove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
If Olga smilingly approve,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Desire to rule ye may observe
Polite demeanour to preserve,
To strike imagination serve.
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Striking the intellect with awe
And supper. In the country we
When the hour came to bid good-bye-
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
And reads with rapid eager eye
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The cynosure of every eye.
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On everything around her gaze,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And long her eyes as through a haze
Extinguished ashes do not blaze-
No, never in the early blaze
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
"But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Him a disquietude did seize,
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Nor the first snow of winter seize
The hero we immortalize.
Who now could fail to recognize
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Having lost all in life we prize.
The calm existence which I prize
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
They made him feel inclined to doze;
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And honestly 'tis my belief
Is ever ready with relief,
This great discovery relief
Habit alleviates the grief
Who in the agony of grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
With deeper woe than others' grief.
Our union would produce but grief.
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petòushkoff
The family of Kharlikoff,
But stop! I will present thee, if
To write of any other elf
Than one's own fascinating self.
Then dressed himself...
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Even beneath her parents' roof
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
The language of her girlish pleading
Page after page continued reading,
However, Tania's letter reading,
But she, her sister never heeding,
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Espy him approaching,
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!”
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Oneguine's letter!”-"Ah! the thing!
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Basins and jugs-well! everything
Also one Viázemski, remarking
And an old gent the poet marking
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But why are your cheeks whitening?”
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
The world is ever altering!
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Or, parable more flattering,
Amidst successes flattering
To our Tattiana conquering,
Upon the meadows showering,
Some other long-departed Spring,
And now she skips and now she spring
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
In life domestic see a string
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Behold! orthography despising,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,-
At last my father gave his blessing,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Follow up love-a secret meeting
To happiness contributing.
Wafted upon poetic wing,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
Metreless verses recognizing
Existence calmly sped along,
Who following Petrarch move along
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The days which to your youth belong?
But send your grandson before long.”
Glittered in a perspective long,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
She gazed-a cue, forgotten long,
And grant success to labour long;
He thought to write, but labour long
The lively trash of stories long
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
The nightingale there all night long,
"The date, his fleeting years how long-
Terpsichore alone among
And thus he never fell among
And wild festivities among
And oft at eventide a throng
He quits the fashionable throng
To whom amongst the jealous throng
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
With little knowledge and that wrong
Repose in peace, thou child of song.”
She brought with her the gift of song.
With dance and with song.
And led me off to church with song.”
Either with him or thee in song,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
A double force unto their song
The Maidens' Song
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Let me explain that in my song
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Enough! my pack is now unslung-
Since I beheld Eugene and young
"I celebrate a comrade young
Her sisterhood delights the young
Were you in love when you were young?”-
Or letters of a maiden young.
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Happy he who in youth was young,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
His harp beneath that sky had rung
He who life's frosts which early wrung
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
Make up your mind to go there.”-"Ah!
The native Russian tongue impeach?
Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
How meekly then I heard you preach-
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Alas! with merited reproach.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
But ultimately doth approach.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Attentive listened to his speech,
Many an ancient legend which
Would she the canvas tight enrich
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
Who to surrender did not blench
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
But home his body to despatch
With gay design and silken stitch.
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
I formerly admired her much
No coquetry was there, I vouch-
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
Society endures not such!
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
With great delight.-O God on high!
"I call to witness God on high-”
Sails her allotted course on high,
And many a caravan on high
The tiny sun shone less on high
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Careless of fame his spirit high
And from the misty woodland nigh
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
List! the snow crunches-he draws nigh!
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
When separation's hour drew nigh,
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Heaved an involuntary sigh
There is no wreath upon the bough:
In scenes like these it may be though,
How dark the night is getting though!
His breast was riddled through and through,
And the eternal lorgnette through
To guess how you the eve pull through.”-
My venerated reader, oh!
They sent their compliments-but oh!
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And pressed her hand-the crimson blush
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Above the humble urn of death.
Affectionately yours till death.
Or counting on his uncle's death
Who early died a gallant death,”
When motionless your gaze beneath
"Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
And what the old man might bequeath.
You o'er your wine insulted hath-
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Or even overcome by wrath
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Without the ken of parents both,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
But memory like a serpent's tooth
The dusty chronicles of earth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
To dire contentment shall give birth
He salutary rules poured forth?
"Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
By the fine silver of the north.
For him were but of little worth,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
The last poor obol I was worth-
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Restrained the impulses of youth;
To the impressions of our youth,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
Found the ideal of my youth,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
In that morass where you and I
My word of honour given have I.
But were it not immoral I
"Not in the least, assured am I!”-
"My darling, growing old am I!
Imagine! Here alone am I!
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
Another! to none other I
But with her elder sister I
But who abandon it-as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
In former years thus did not I
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
To listen to the words you speak,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Incessantly his chains to break.”
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
Bruin is marching at her back!
And the sagacious Triquet back
Himself transformed into a hack;
Passes the torrent But alack!
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
In truth he had the happy trick
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick-
And he had made her heart beat quick!
He loved the simpleton to mock,
The artful prisoner should seek
And thus secures the prey we seek.
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
At times, if only once a week,
They have invited you this week.”
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
And then a cup of coffee drank,
A door he opens. But why shrank
He's a freemason, so we think.
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook-
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
Into accounts would sometimes look,
But somehow there shone in his look
How bright and tender was his look,
To flight before her radiant look,
Calling to mind your icy look
And shut him in a lonely nook.
The little solitary nook
His course unto the running brook.
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
How thoroughly her part she took!
And flowed harmoniously. He took
To ask her name the trouble took.
And clad in airy costume took
An honourable course ye took,
Jealousy and vexation took
Caught him and by the collar took
Till absently Vladimir took
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
Assemblies oligarchical
They deem her somewhat finical,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Ye men of fashion cynical,
And female tears hysterical,
Already he grew phthisical.
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Economy political,
A fop, in dress pedantical.
And cannot anything conceal,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
When the mazurka used to peal,
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What will the coming dawn reveal?
For promises her feet reveal
Outlandish and provincial,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
And with gray hair ambrosial
Lo! with what pride celestial
Nought of its charms original
Yet suffering emotional
He deemed of human life the goal
The path which leads to glory's goal.
And others rise ephemeral!
The eyes of a grave general.
Behind her a grave general.
A ball in Peter's capital,
In one thing really did excel.
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
When first upon my cheek I feel
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
To such-delightful to repel.
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Until her powers of running fail.
Though of romance therein I fail
With eye precise and without fail.
In time I'll give ye without fail
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Winter's approach she doth not hail
The sharp incisions of his nail,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
A true account and in detail.
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail-
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
God grant I meet not at a ball
Another tribune of the ball
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
She soon forgot, began to call
Was that which we are wont to call
So, when he came next day to call,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
The rigour of cold pride and all
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
A whisper runs along the hall,
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Some future ignoramus shall
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
For long he had endured them all.
Nor years of separation all
Bedding is laid out and to all
Indifferent he became to all,
A white and undulating pall
The snow descends and buries all,
Her sentimental verses all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Morality taught scarce at all;
They shout and no one lists at all.
Was not surprised thereby at all.
He knits his brows-'tis silent all.
I envied sore the billows tall,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Hung like a print against the wall,
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Long in this fashionable cell
For consecrate to me he fell
The lady's glance upon him fell-
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
Repentance wields not now her spell
Of languor and of love did tell
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
The steward sent a note to tell
"I am in love,” her whispers tell
I am-in love-you know-don't tell!”
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell-
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
At thirty who was married well,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
I have no leisure here to dwell,
Ennui can in the country dwell
And think: here lies who loved me well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
And wished to say to him farewell.
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
"The family are all quite well-
Are all your relatives quite well?
How thy hands burn!”-"Dear nurse, I'm well.
To take this letter to O- Well!
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
His relative and friend as well.
And gallicisms I love as well
And sometimes into snares as well
This separated us as well-
Petòushkoff, the provincial swell;
At twenty who was prig or swell,
"My heart's delight, thou art not well.”-
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Oneguine acted very well
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill-”
My unpretending page shall fill,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Proceeds, until she from a hill
The pervert world with icy chill
And wisely gallops to the hill.
Let us proceed unto a rill,
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
To listen to the rippling rill.
A garden by a shining rill.
"'Tis habit, Lenski.”-"Is your ill
An hour passed by-another-till,
His heart reciprocated still
The coach before a house stood still.
Domestic life attracts me still,
"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?”-
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
To wander through the meadows still,
With tumult or contentment still
You fall in love again. But still-
Time was, the poet's tender quill
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Thus a guest with composure will
(See the first canto if ye will),
To stay the maid against her will.
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Perchance they laurels also cull-
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
Rings from a dish of water full
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
In order due the maidens pull;
You know that I am now a fool-
At eighteen not to play the fool!
He was a dear delightful fool-
He used to hate-and was no fool-
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Conventionality's dull tool-
Learn to possess more self-control.
"Monsieur l'Abbe” a starving Gaul,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
And Eugene ever in her soul
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Of your perfections in my soul,
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
And a boy handed round the cream.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
But Tania just as in a dream
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Eugene at first began to dream,
The story of his young love's dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
All this may be an empty dream,
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
A wish from place to place to roam,
Back to his regiment must roam.
'Twould serve ye in an epigram-
And a malicious epigram
And love's delicious diadem
Merciful God, what will he deem?”
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
Providence otherwise may deem-
Of priceless value all things seem
With mute appeal to ask they seem-
He hath acquired the world's esteem
But, as he never opened them,
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
Is ever ready to proclaim
With such a perversity proclaim.
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
In winter by its blank and dim
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
And the lime alley's twilight dim
Of what not, and of distant dim,
But could not. Then she questioned him:-
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Where the first time she met with him.
Its driver seated on the rim
From first to last page to the rim.
He sang of separation grim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
A country damsel's album trim,
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
In some a willing martyrdom.
"Is she in love?” quoth one. "With whom?
She waited for-I don't know whom!
Petòushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!”-
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
The forests in mysterious gloom
This is my master's sitting-room.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
"Had he been long here, and where from?
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monster's arm,
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
Fantastic images shall swarm
Laid down his life of sun and storm
A Russian poem's mechanism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
Indeed, by force of magnetism
How like a poet was my chum
He "Benedetta” used to hum,
He had excepted from the ban:
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Romances three, in which ye scan
'Twas plain-an oaken floor ye scan,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
Oneguine slowly then began
And my Tattiana now began
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
"How came you then to wed a man?”-
Vladimir's property, a man
At last became a ruined man.
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Let me present ye to the man,
He was an honest gentleman,
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Portrayed contemporary man
Eugene directs the trusty man
Four deadly paces do they span;
I feel, allotted is my span;
Deep into debt his father ran;
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
Portray the solitary den
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
In her friends' albums, time had been,
There friends of pure delight had been
Assuredly should not have been
The butt of scandal having been,
Had a deluded victim been
A fond and careful mother been.
Obedient she had ever been
And fields my joys have ever been;
Which never have existed, e'en
Become a faithful wife and e'en
"Come,” she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Repose from labour, satire keen,
What a storm of emotions keen
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Was nothing but the British spleen
The lonely mansion-house to screen
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
As your light footprints on the green.
In springtime on the meadows green,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
To this arrangement can be seen,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
The torment born of crime unseen,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”-
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before him red roast beef is seen
But nothing changed in them is seen,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
In little maidens of thirteen?
His malady, whose cause I ween
Writ in my honour now and then-
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
"Oneguine, I was younger then,
His friendship I acquired just then;
The cold reply with gloomy mien
Approach not to hearken
The tale of these romantic men;
To pass with reasonable men
E sempre bene, gentlemen!
Amid submissive herds of men
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Having abjured the haunts of men,
And isolated from all men,
So inaccessible to men,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
The poet fell; already men
Yawning betook him to a pen.
I know that Parny's tender pen
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Another his betrothed was given;
The imagination to enliven
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
By sympathy I have been driven.
The memory of the bard was driven
Oneguine was a citizen
How deftly could he transport feign!
An exile from their troublous reign,
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
How bitterly he would malign,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
All bustle when he makes a sign:
Landscapes thereon he would design,
At times talk nonsense with design;
But boldly I myself resign:
My heart's allegiance can resign,
Thine honour is my countersign!
Men opposite. The cross they sign
My gratitude do not disdain,
To crush me with a just disdain.
Listen to me without disdain.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Should dearly like a dance again.
Shall I behold thee once again?”-
But to the garden once again
The youthful lover once again
Oneguine, bored to death again,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
Oneguine-take him up again-
That until Christmas comes again
Of love again, and yet again;
A maid hath oft, may yet again
And agitate my heart again;
Or if he meant to flirt again,
It wakens in my breast again.
Tattiana courage doth regain
By an avowal just as plain.
He there is master-that is plain;
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Detest him for a brother slain?
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?”-
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Would she in silence long remain.
As deaf and silly doth remain,
He obstinately will remain,
But, that life longer may remain,
And gave himself but little pain
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
Me now, inflict upon me pain?-
And an habitual sense of pain;
Spare yourself unavailing pain
"My darling child, thou art in pain.-
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
I know not if his heart felt pain
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
After the wedded couple strain;
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain-”
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
The dream left terror in its train.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Or e'en the "Demon” of my strain.
Tania the meaning would obtain
A case of books he doth obtain-
I loved you-what did I obtain?
My light productions to retain,
Although her book did not contain
The household property contain:
His daughter's book to ascertain
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
And distance interposed in vain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
He reads at random, reads in vain.
And far removed from rumour vain;
I've wasted in amusements vain,
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
The converse of our hermits twain,
To raise a clamour and a din:
In solitude or worldly din,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Ere conversation could begin,
But by degrees the crowd begin
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
With words of foreign origin
The pall of night was growing thin,
At morn an icy bath within
He heard his soul's complaint within,
Still everywhere, without, within,
Where-”-"What! another eclogue spin?
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Pardon I ask for such a sin-
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
In books he saw nought to condemn
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
A canine face with horns thereon,
And that unrivalled paragon,
And gossip of the town and fashion
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The torrent of opinion,
Behold! the world's opinion!
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
The natural fickleness of passion,
The youthful poet's fond confession.
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
With quite a lachrymose expression
He enters: rapidly discussion
Who without more prevarication
We all of us of education
Oneguine went with trepidation
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
But Eugene, hating litigation
With inexact pronunciation
And tears of reconciliation:
Tattiana was her appellation.
Although it will not bear translation,
A coquette loves by calculation,
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Not high in general estimation;
Enhances love in estimation
And hot with jealous indignation,
And sulked in silent indignation;
Of such a dread hallucination.
Invigorate imagination
Long time her young imagination
Original imagination,
She did not think "procrastination
Of foreign whims the impersonation-
Triumphant by anticipation,
Their Jealousy and separation
The fair of the next generation,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
And eye which gleams with inspiration-
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
The idols of their adoration
In pages of a love narration
The hero is of my narration!
The poet's fervid conversation
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
Without constraint in conversation
Not knowing its interpretation,
Alone within his habitation
A Vampire fond of meditation,
An innate love of meditation,
And buried deep in meditation,
As formerly much agitation.
And long internal agitation
And marking Tania's agitation,
A love which knew no limitation,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Thy meditative incantation-
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Amid a serious disputation,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
To the sarcastic observation,
By what idea or observation
With intellect and strong volition
Meantime Oneguine's apparition
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Quite a sensation; the position
My very latest composition!
And a determined disposition,
For journalistic deglutition
The same unmoved oblivion
Rescue me from oblivion.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Beneath the silver of the moon
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
'Tis silent-on her shines the moon-
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
"Why did you leave last night so soon?”
Submissive as if in a swoon,
His wife was also mad upon
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Without disgust we look upon?
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His spirit was intent upon.
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The counsel good and full of reason,
And the cold beauties of the season:
To visit Moscow in the season.
She was thus fond of Richardson
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Or that adoring Grandison
Was certainly no Grandison.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?”
Sailed silently in unison-
There an imperious skeleton;
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To write his forefathers to warn
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Tattiana-thus the sex is born.-
He seemed for matrimony born.
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
A jolly song and distant horn;
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn-
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Perchance you also soon may burn,
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Do we alone our losses mourn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Delighted glances in return;
Have entered never to return.
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Then to some gallant in your turn
Men will forget me, but my urn
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,”
Across the smiling face of dawn.
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
In silence shall I sit and yawn
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And on the footstool sitting down
And at the table sat her down.
And the fair sex as light as down!
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
I feel thou wast by God sent down
Approach, approach; I am thine own.”
The aged nurse in ample gown,
In a half-open dressing-gown
You never since your nose have shown.
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
The opportunity is flown.
For summer to the country flown,
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Besides, a duellist well-known
For o'er a word to fashion known,
And bitter torment never known.
What everybody long has known;
He is not there: I am not known:
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
Have one by one all withered grown
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
"Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown-
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown-
This northern summer of our own,
When will the devil take his own!”
Impelled to union with his own
Far from his Italy-his own.
And the young damsel from the town,
Troy's sages should in concert own
He left you first, and I must own
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
But tell me what am I to do?
Which we experienced long ago.
Familiar to him long ago.
Made me so tipsy long ago!
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
They hand in hand to table go.
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go-
Whither that evening he will go.
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go.”-
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
But say he was a genius who
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
I cannot understand. But lo!
"Is he known to you?”-"Yes and No.”
"And is it she? It must be-no-
Present me.”-"You are joking.”-"No.”-
More troublesome than usual?”-"No!
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
And usually despised it too),
My beauty, thou art ready too.
Yet let us part in friendship, O
But would not look at Cicero.
"To-?”-"Larina.”-"Tattiana?”-"So.
Inspired him with disgust and so
"Shall we commence?”-"Let it be so,”
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
And so my noon hath come! If so,
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?”-
No more remembered him; unto
For was it not her duty to
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
Together moments one or two
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Or a professor in tulle cap.
The lady in the crimson cap
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
He's a straightforward little chap.”
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
With iridescent wing doth flap
And all in snow is buried deep.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Buried in meditation deep,
Long time in meditation deep
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
But stares into the darkness deep.
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
The maids beside Tattiana keep-
Her path across the plain doth keep-
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Girls in anticipation skip!
With one foot resting on its tip
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
The sudden rattling of a car.
Since in these arms I thee did bear-
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
All are constrained and fetters bear,
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
From everything the heart held dear
Come to my golden palace, dear!
I can't conceive a little dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear;
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Not only sorrow-Ah! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear-
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fear-
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
She will not see, she will not hear.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
To be in conversation clear
There is a spot the village near
With sad refrain misfortune near.
And dost thou know her?”-"We live near.”
A friar black approaching near,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Mysteriously all objects near
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
He daily in his drives drew near
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
Do me a favour and appear.
So irremissible appear?
Would at the proper time appear.
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Never for me to reappear-
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
For which no springtime shall appear?
But as to fighting-'twill appear!
Two dressed in uniform appear-
Doth in us or our names appear
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
The shining orbs of night appear;
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
And happy unto you appear.
More advantageously appear
A vision desolate and drear
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
All is foreseen. My secret drear
He bending whispered in her ear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
The simple epitaph-a tear
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
For us, may be for many a year.
Long ago?”-"'Tis the second year.”
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
And from the Millionaya afar
And grown more curious by far
Unhappily too salt by far;
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar”
As in the timid forest deer,
And exclamations and good cheer.
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Gliding in negligent career,
Amid the company career.
"At Larina's.”-"Hem, that is queer!
To lawless love I should prefer-
"Well!”-"I the elder should prefer,
Girls the kashourka much prefer.
Romance of love I pray refer,
And traces with a slender finger
Tania doth by the casement linger
Adroitly seized and carried her;
And like a shadow haunted her.
"The younger, you're in love with her!”
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Unfavourable unto her.
He leisurely adorns for her.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
To Eve the universal mother,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Gravely repeating to another
Aye bids ye in some way or other-
But finally grew bored by her.
Servant of God and brigadier,
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
Together we have wandered o'er
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Malicious and a slanderer.
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Confront thy fated torturer!
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.-
This was his social character.
What is his latest character?
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”-
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
I'm beaten in another matter;
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
At Russ she was by no means clever
Appear; along the road of Tver
Hope with her fascinating power
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fair-
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Describe in detail the affair,
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Pray is it not a tough affair
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
I have dreamed many a vision fair
The gossip of their ladies fair.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
The less we love a lady fair
I uttered to my lady fair
With the epistle of my fair;
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
A kerchief round her silver hair
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
But with confused and bashful air,
And vanish like a bird in air.
Finally tost his arms in air
And the Skatenines, aged pair,
Approaches Olga and the pair
Around the carriage of the pair-
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
He knows Kaverine will repair.
The freshness of her heart impair,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Accents of rapture or despair
Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
Kvass needful was to them as air;
Urging your droshkies swift as air
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Mark ye with what a modest air
Fles past the porter to the stair,
'Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
But gray Phillippevna the door
She cannot-Eugene oped the door
She peeped through a chink of the door.
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Anicia soon appears, the door
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Lest the malicious reader or
Is petted by the Emperor?-
Some one or other editor
Opens unto her visitor.
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
And sermon-but in that dread hour
Impressionable for an hour,
I blame not your behaviour-
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Pelagie Nikolavna has
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Oneguine fired-Alas! alas!
In this case quite mistaken was.
Still of his club he member was-
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With tranquil air Oneguine leads
His wife approaches, with him leads
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
That crass stupidity misleads,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
She the delicious novel reads,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
And all that from thy hand proceeds-
"Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
Already dance to song proceeds;
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And a grand festival proceeds.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
Professions eagerly for deeds,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
To bring behind: the triple steeds
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Are ye replaced by other maids
Tattiana to a corner, bids
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
His son and mortgages his lands.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The father scarcely understands
Where each young critic ready stands,
With bated breath, around she bends
At times my reason almost bends,
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Tattiana from the hill descends
Then glittering in the sun descends.
No one my anguish comprehends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Triumphs-their own or those of friends-
I've had to make for having friends!
Against my inclination, friends,
Existence without wife or friends,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
Their harmless conversation blends
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
His hate by slander, and who spends
And care but little for its ends.
On us beyond the grave attends,
O feet, where'er your path extends
With love which happiness extends;
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And wild among them grew her words-
At least their accents and their words
Of passion reminiscences,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
My goddesses, where are your shades?
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
The remnant destiny concedes,
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
Tattiana motionless abides.
The unbidden guests he roughly chides-
And supercilious dames she glides,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
A crab upon a spider rides,
Sits down and gazes on all sides-
Of migratory gipsy hordes-
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
May be that I by heaven's decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The serpent to unlawful trees
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
Not the least trace Oneguine sees
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
And nothing more important sees;
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
And all thy precious elegies,
Around the garden homeward hies.
And overcome antipathies
The shutters open; to the skies
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Where all upon the surface lies,-
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Look through the window and kill flies.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Tattiana to the index flies
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
When the same life before him lies
What more's required? The world replies,
Ever to hear the same replies
All breathless and without replies.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
A sportsman who in covert lies.
Had come both friends and enemies-
His friends and also enemies
And the bad book accompanies.
The general who accompanies.
To bear love's parching agonies-
Thrice happy who their agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
She from the winter corn espies
Some a mazurka occupies,
He roars, and "Ah!” Tattiana cries.
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Upon those pages she descries
Even the rosy wafer dries
Past palaces and nunneries,
In the world's mortal revelries,
And pelt him with cherries,
With raspberries, cherries.
To peer into the future tries.
And alphabetically tries
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
My splendid house and gaieties-
From public and from private ties,
Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
At neighbouring hospitalities.
And fashion's gay frivolities;
I yield for splendid vanities,
The gilding of life's vanities,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Spared him not their asperities.
The country hath its liberties
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room; aside each takes
He now a full possession takes,
Without grammatical mistakes.
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
His recent glory he invokes.
Also, to equalise the scales,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
She got a book of nursery tales,
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
But lights incendiary flames
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
To banish far unworthy themes
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
And due precautions take betimes.
Alas! he loved as in our times
I sail upon my lake at times
And the young revellers of past times
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
The fisher's fire afar illumes
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes-
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Her head upon her breast declines
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Longer the East inert reclines
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Wherein love innocently pines.
The golden ember now enshrines,
And fashionable magazines,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
And now he views forgotten foes,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
And meditative homeward goes,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
All arise. To the door he goes.
Into the tangled garden goes
All vanished as an echo goes.
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
The accents wild of other's woes,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
He fixedly upon her stares-
The husband comes and interferes
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Imagination's sacred fires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
As with innumerable fires.
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And now his youthful heart desires
And of the irksome harness tires,
Jackdaws on every spire-in scores.
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
In true interpretation hates:
And slowly life coagulates-
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
And what like menaces fatigues,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Which shines with iridescent hues.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
A victim decked with golden leaves;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Our liberty at least survives:
She the acquaintances she loves,
To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
His travels like all other things
The peasants there are rich as kings,
But still remembrance to him clings,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
Happy and glorious. But this brings
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Obedient to the magic strings,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
The time between the wolf and dogs-
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Calmly her eyes encounter his-
Eugene, more tolerant than this
And deem the world perfection is!
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
I just hint, in parenthesis,
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”-
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
The old man who has had his freaks,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
For the first time the hammer clicks.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
A horse's hoofs she hears-She shrinks!
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
But now-my very blood congeals,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
May yet be studious of his nails;
And beckon to the passing sails.
Custom the despot soon prevails.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
When the sonorous Breguet tells
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And the heart's agitated dreams.
For rural solitude and dreams,
And where Thalia softly dreams
To agitate me in my dreams.
Descended swift in turbid streams
And where the admirable streams
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And heedless of approval seems,
Awhile sound conversation seems
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
And more imagination teems.
Glory with which our history teems
Of conversation, thought and aims-
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
The frolics of maidens.
The secrets of maidens.
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Insensible her hand remains
His kneeling posture he retains-
To secrets of virgins,
Friends and companions,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Old people's simple conversations
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Latest arrivals' salutations,
They were the wonderful traditions
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
But to Oneguine! A propos!
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
In country towns, where still it keeps
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
And lonely through the forest creeps.”
I will not wed, and ever weeps
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
The two friends' compliments she hears
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they come-Eugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears-
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
(So 'twas with us in former years,
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But fools-their calumnies and sneers”-
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
In the world's vortex my success,
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess-
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oft-this I myself confess-
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
"If the domestic hearth could bless-
Me your perfections would not bless;
Also their feet-yet ne'ertheless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess;
He cannot give me happiness.”
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
"'Twas possible then, happiness-
"But strange am I to happiness;
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Their slander e'en was weariness;
In old age life is weariness!”
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixed-with thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
But Eugene long hath left the press
A young Armida's lips to press,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
To fawn upon and love express;
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express-
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
Love's tender transports and distress,
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
A strong resemblance these possess-
Tattiana's letter I possess,
If wife and children to possess
If the raw product they possess
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
The uncontaminated kiss
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,-
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Even amusing fools we miss
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fuss-
Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
As every journal now entreats,
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
And stay whose length none recollects.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Leaning against the dam expects,
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Whom latterly one often meets
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Though without palaces and streets,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
With cherries, red currants,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
But, after mutual compliments,
The epistle from the bard presents.
She visited the humble tents
The hours once more Oneguine counts,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
Ever receive with kindly hearts
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
We Russians, friends from distant parts
The Paris of those country parts
Deliberate approach of guests
Variety of speech and vests,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
And like Napoleons each of us
The stomach doth admonish us.
A million bipeds reckons thus
Corneille's majestic genius,
Whereto in language courteous
Yea! although rendered beauteous
A critic of the stage malicious,
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
A slave of actresses capricious,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
Oh! who is not calumnious?
There Didelot became glorious,
She seemed of him oblivious,
By such allusions scandalous,
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
How mean, how pusillanimous!
Amid sly, pusillanimous
The drive becomes monotonous-
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Thou also, reader generous,
Then ye were barely generous,
It was a cheery, generous
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Abandon cities riotous,
Well! Larina appears to us
Come sing we in chorus
Who labours hard to humour us?
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
The friend of liberty and laws
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
His watch, the sun in turn he views-
Perverse, unfavourable views?
And through the lofty windows views
To male acquaintances he bows,
The men salute with lower bows
The epitaph on marble shows:
With all dissatisfaction shows.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
When Passion's fire no longer glows
Before a fire which feebly glows
And this the faithful one allows,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
For otherwise-God only knows!
The first appearance of the snows
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Through dense aristocratic rows
On unknown female forms he throws.
The connoisseur his glances throws
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows-
And I confess that now-a-days
But even thus not now-a-days!
Of fiery youth's untutored days
To vary for a few brief days.
Alas! the friend of childish days
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
We called to mind our youthful days-
That vanished are my youthful days
As the sins of my youthful days
As partner of my mournful days,
And then to meditate for days
The very morning of our days.
Companion of my childhood's days.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
In one of thine enchanting lays
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
No more with pale Diana's rays,
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Alas! my stomach it betrays
When he in ardent verse portrays
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Oneguine his excuses says;
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Or parody of modern ways?
But soon she altered all her ways,
Delighted much his former ways
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And hates the world's discordant ways.
Unto Anicia for the keys
The household troop of little boys,
A joyous troop of little boys
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Who cannot conjure former joys?
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Age immature averse to cheat-
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
And in a whisper did repeat:
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
I mean my name not to repeat.”
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Which lessons unto us repeat,
A hundred times will not repeat,
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
And at economy was great;
Alone amid possessions great,
And cry: he was a poet great!
On this artistical retreat
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
When in the study's calm retreat,
A ball here, there a children's treat,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Abandoned he his country seat,
Removed her to his country seat,
Approach not to gaze at
Begins to talk of this and that,
"No misery I see in that”-
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
Her brow she did not e'en contract
And blush to own himself reflect.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
With so much warmth and intellect?
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?-
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
Such am I. This did ye expect,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet-
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Are oft deceptive-like their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But now-what brings you to my feet?-
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
Near Khariton's in a side street
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”
Wherein I castigation get;
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour when-Fate so willed-we met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And we-an unattractive set-
A simple tombstone hath been set.
On whom a sister's heart was set
Of every sort and every set!”-
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
"Then amongst strangers I was left-
Of consolation all bereft-
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
But from the Muses' loftiest height
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,-
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
"I with my friend intend to fight!”
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olga-to a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
E'en for an instant find delight,
"But death from him will be delight.
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
Who in thy love finds more delight
To find in gossip such delight,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
In such an album with delight
They will receive us with delight.”
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
And like the prisoner's our delight
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
As a babe's slumber, or the light
Or but for fame he saw the light;
And Schiller read by candlelight.
Bu, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight;
There came a sudden flash of light,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light-
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light-
And showed with an uncertain light
His care unto his pistols' plight,
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Arising with the morning's light,
That the two friends with morning's light
But lo! already the moon's light
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The china teapot too ye might
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happy-as I might.
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night-
Terror of guardians of the night;
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night-
Full many a lovely star hath night
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
And glasses unemployed all night;
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
"Delighted.”-"When?”-"This very night.
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
And better, if I judge aright;
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright-
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Adorned with many a vision bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
And form a network left and right;
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
In the first place, say, am I right?
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught;
I am not worthy them in aught;
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
And my dark soul to light was brought;
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?-
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought-
The "in memoriam” pages sought,
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bit-
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
Oneguine could not now submit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit-
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The snow upon the streets doth melt-
Whither along them doth he pelt?
E'en as the poet says he leant.
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
And o'er the granite coping bent,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent;
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Shines in the female firmament
With scandal's trivial ornament.
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
A timid love to banishment?-
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But now-none heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent-
"You have a letter to me sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content;
And scanned in silence its content.
So Tania to her heart's content
In course of time (the whole extent
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
'Tis time she to the altar went!
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went;
Oneguine to the window went
The Larinas unwisely went,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font-
A forest now she sees in front
In spite of common sense we're wont
And I to give thee cakes was wont?”-
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Ourselves as unities to count;
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot-
Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot;
My country and an exile's lot;
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
To Russ indigenous are not;
Just at this moment I cannot.
One moment's slumber suffer not.
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart-
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
A maiden's secrets-of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?-
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart-
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
How well he played the greenhorn's part
How soon he learnt deception's art,
By flattery and lover's art-
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
Vociferously paid her court,
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
That youthful heart-"But, now at least,
He was beloved: or say at least,
Ah! I'm so weak-my throbbing breast!
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!”
Bard of the "Feasts,” and mournful breast,
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
"I weep. And if within your breast
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
'Twas she who first within his breast
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
The fatal hour had come at last-
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
But this is my advice, 'twere best
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest-
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest;
Like you and me and all the rest?-
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest-
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
By fond illusions once possest
(This joking I used to protest),
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And so-God bless them, if He list.
Am I to go through the whole list?”
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist-
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
That every morn at Verrey's cost
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,-
By their own horses, not the post-
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
Who words and actions will adjust
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about-
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
"My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt;
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!-for you
"But, mátushka, to Moscow you
ETOT FILE CHISTIL MAXIM KATKOV
And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholy's claw
Obedient then to Nature's law,
He offers her his murderous paw;
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Russia's Terpsichore review
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
(Though certainly mankind he knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show-
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?-
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
They sat, but conversation's flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now-
Society he duped enow.”
The unaffected traits she now
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
And in the morning doth not know
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
"Tania, my eldest child, you know”-
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now;
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Till January fell no snow-
But such is not my project now,
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
And all your love on self bestow;
And linen on him doth bestow.
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jilted-glad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
We visit about Christmas Day,
She gazed around her-it was day.
And wholly occupied his day-
Olga's admirer came that day:
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
That he was "ready any day.”
She was as heedless and as gay-
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till morn-life uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay-
The bridegroom sage without delay
"Bring dinner now without delay!”
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
"How often in thine arms I lay;
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
'Tis there that arrant fops display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay-
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay-
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray-
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?”-
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say-
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late; he must not stay;
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away;
Oneguine Olga bore away.
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
And to Oneguine far away
But thoughts meander far away-
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
The lily's stem to eat away,
Unto her husband, went away-
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way;
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Ah! he has gone the other way”-
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
Ivan Petròvitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
Oneguine sat the table by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And like a palisade flit by.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
And (elbows on the table) they
To consanguineous dinners they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey;
A lover's letter might convey,
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy;
At least by show of sympathy;
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
I cannot tell the reason why,
She fears she cannot.-Cannot? Why?-
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
"No matter, look immediately.
Took aim-but as immediately
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Or innocently past me fly.
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
"Who will be there?”-"The family.
What say you? to the family-
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally;
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
But of this love, e'en casually,
To all she answers cruelly-
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Have my Oneguine-suddenly.
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
"What! Grandison?”-"Yes, certainly!”
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Though I'll return to him right early,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
You'll spend your winter famously!
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
"Then send your grandson quietly
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Then he'd malign them secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly;
Employ your glasses constantly,
She cannot-then impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
"And he-but of him presently-
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany-
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Then be it so! My destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry-
Dark shadows thicken-a dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
And turned aside the drapery;
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
Sed alia tempora. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Relate some ancient history.”
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
That Nina's marble symmetry,
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass; the same to-morrow try-
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Byron's capricious phantasy
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy;
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
By the sick lady's gaiety
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity;
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
And husbands' tedious amity?
But grant with magnanimity
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity-
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
As giddy youth's hilarity-
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
With us 'tis quite a novelty
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thought-retirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
